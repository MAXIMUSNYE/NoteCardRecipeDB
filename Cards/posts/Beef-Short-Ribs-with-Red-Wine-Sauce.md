| Beef short ribs | 4 lbs |
| Salt | 2 tsp |
| Black pepper | 1 tsp |
| Olive oil | 2 tbsp |
| Garlic cloves (minced) | 4 |
| Fresh rosemary | 2 sprigs |
| Fresh thyme | 2 sprigs |

### For the Red Wine Sauce

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Red wine | 2 cups |
| Butter | 2 tbsp |
| Shallots (diced) | 2 |
| Garlic cloves (minced) | 2 |
| Beef broth | 1 cup |
| Salt | To taste |
| Black pepper | To taste |

## Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F.
2. Sprinkle salt and black pepper over the short ribs, making sure they are coated evenly.
3. In a dutch oven or any oven-safe pot, heat the olive oil on medium-high heat. When hot, sear the short ribs on both sides until they are browned then remove from the pot and set them aside.
4. In the same pot, add the minced garlic and sauté until it is fragrant.
5. Add the beef broth, rosemary and thyme sprigs to the pot and bring the mixture to a boil.
6. Once boiling, add the seared short ribs to the pot. Cover the pot with a lid and place it in the preheated oven for 2 to 2.5 hours, or until the short ribs are tender.
7. While the short ribs are cooking, start preparing the red wine sauce. In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the diced shallots and sauté until they are translucent.
8. Add the minced garlic to the shallots and cook for 30 seconds.
9. Pour the red wine into the saucepan and let it come to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the mixture for about 10 minutes or until the wine has reduced by half.
10. Add the beef broth to the saucepan, stir, and let the mixture simmer for another 5 minutes.
11. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper to taste, then remove the pot from the heat.
12. Once the beef short ribs are done, remove them from the oven and transfer them to a plate.
13. Strain the cooking liquid from step 6 into a saucepan and discard the herbs and any solids. Bring the cooking liquid to a simmer over medium heat and let it reduce by half.
14. Add the prepared red wine sauce to the skillet and whisk the mixture until everything is combined. Let the sauce simmer for 5 minutes until it has thickened.
15. Spoon the red wine sauce over the beef short ribs and serve hot.

Enjoy your delicious Beef Short Ribs with Red Wine Sauce!
