## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the marinade: soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, green onions, and black pepper. Mix well.

2. Add the thinly sliced chicken breast to the marinade. Mix well, ensuring that every piece of chicken is coated in the marinade. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and let marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

3. After 30 minutes, remove the chicken from the marinade, but reserve the remaining marinade for later.

4. In a shallow dish, coat the chicken with cornstarch.

5. Heat a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Add vegetable oil and wait for it to heat up.

6. Add the thinly sliced onions and stir fry for 1-2 minutes or until they start to become tender.

7. Add the chicken and stir fry for 5-7 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.

8. Add the red bell pepper and carrots, and stir fry for an additional 2-3 minutes or until the vegetables are tender-crisp.

9. Pour in the reserved marinade you set aside earlier. Stir well and let it simmer for 1-2 minutes or until the sauce has thickened and coated the chicken and vegetables.

10. Add the chopped green onions and stir well.

11. Serve hot with steamed rice.
