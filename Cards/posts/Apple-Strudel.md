# Apple Strudel Recipe

## Ingredients

### Dough

| Quantity | Ingredient |
|----------|------------|
| 2 cups   | All-purpose flour |
| 1/4 tsp  | Salt |
| 1/3 cup  | Vegetable oil |
| 1/2 cup  | Warm water |

### Filling

| Quantity | Ingredient |
|----------|------------|
| 4   | Apples, peeled and thinly sliced |
| 1/4 cup  | Sugar |
| 1 tsp    | Ground cinnamon |
| 1/4 tsp  | Ground nutmeg |
| 1/2 cup  | Raisins |
| 1/4 cup  | Butter, melted |
| 1/2 cup  | Bread crumbs |

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. To make the dough, combine the flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add the vegetable oil and mix until crumbly. Pour in the warm water and mix until the dough comes together. Knead the dough on a floured surface until it becomes smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, mix the sliced apples, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and raisins.
4. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a thin rectangular shape.
5. Brush the melted butter onto the dough. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top of the melted butter.
6. Spread the apple mixture evenly onto the dough.
7. Starting from one end, carefully roll up the dough (like a jelly roll).
8. Place the rolled-up dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
9. Brush the top of the dough with butter.
10. Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until golden brown.
11. Allow the apple strudel to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
12. Optional: dust with powdered sugar or serve with whipped cream. 

Enjoy your homemade Apple Strudel!
