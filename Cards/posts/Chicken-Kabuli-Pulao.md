## Instructions

1. Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in cold water for 30 minutes.

2. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add salt, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaves. Drain the soaked rice and add it to the pot. Stir and bring it to a boil again. Once boiled, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 15-18 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked.

3. In a bowl, mix chicken thighs, Greek yogurt, minced garlic, minced ginger, salt, coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric, cayenne, lemon juice, and oil. Marinate the chicken in the mixture for at least an hour or overnight in the fridge.

4. In a skillet, heat 2 tbsp oil on medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and cook for 10-12 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.

5. In another skillet, heat 2 tbsp oil on medium heat. Add julienned carrots and cook for 6-8 minutes until they turn tender. Add raisins and sliced almonds and cook for another 2-3 minutes.

6. In a large serving dish, layer the rice on the bottom, add the cooked chicken on top of the rice, and finally, sprinkle the almond, raisin, and carrot mixture on top.

7. Serve warm and enjoy!

Note: You can also garnish it with more sliced almonds and chopped parsley if you want.
