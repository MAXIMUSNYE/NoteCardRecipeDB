# Eggs Benedict Recipe

Eggs Benedict is a classic breakfast dish consisting of two halves of an English muffin, each topped with Canadian bacon (or ham), a poached egg, and hollandaise sauce. Here's how to make this decadent dish at home:


## Ingredients:

|Component                  |Ingredients                     |
|---------------------------|:-------------------------------|
|English muffin             |2 English muffins, halved       |
|Canadian bacon (or ham)    |4-8 slices                       |
|Poached eggs               |4 large eggs                    |
|Hollandaise sauce          |3 egg yolks, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, plus more melted butter as needed|


## Instructions:

1. To poach the eggs, fill a large, deep skillet with water and bring it to a simmer over medium heat. Crack 2 eggs into the skillet and let them cook for 3-4 minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Use a slotted spoon to remove the eggs from the skillet and transfer them to a plate. Repeat with the remaining 2 eggs.
2. To make the hollandaise sauce, whisk the egg yolks, water, and lemon juice together in a small pan over low heat. Continue whisking until the yolks thicken and start to foam, but be careful not to overheat. Remove from heat.
3. Slowly whisk in the melted butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce is thick and creamy. If the sauce is too thick, add more melted butter as needed.
4. Preheat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. Cook the Canadian bacon for 2-3 minutes on each side, until lightly browned.
5. While the bacon is cooking, toast the English muffin halves until golden brown. 
6. To assemble the eggs Benedict, place a slice of Canadian bacon on top of each English muffin half. Carefully place a poached egg on top of the bacon, then generously spoon hollandaise sauce over the top.
7. Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade Eggs Benedict!

Note: You can add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste to the hollandaise sauce for extra flavor.
