# Homemade Gnocchi Recipe

Looking for a delicious and easy-to-make homemade gnocchi recipe? Look no further than this step-by-step guide! With just a few simple ingredients and a little bit of time, you can have fresh, flavorful gnocchi that will impress even the most discerning diners.

## Ingredients

### For the Gnocchi

| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Russet potatoes | 2 lbs |
| All-purpose flour | 1-2 cups |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Egg | 1 |

### For the Sauce

| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Olive oil | 2 tbsp |
| Garlic, minced | 2 cloves |
| Crushed tomatoes | 28 oz can |
| Salt | 1 tsp |

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F. Scrub the potatoes clean and prick them all over with a fork. Place them on a baking sheet and bake for about an hour, or until they're tender and fully cooked.

2. Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before peeling them. Pass the potatoes through a ricer or a food mill, or mash them with a potato masher until you have a fluffy texture.

3. Add the flour and salt to the potatoes and make a well in the center. Crack the egg into the well and, using a fork, whisk the egg lightly and gradually incorporate the flour and potatoes from the edges of the well until you have a smooth ball of dough.

4. Once you have a ball of dough, dust your workspace with flour and cut the dough into four sections. Roll each section into a long, thin rope about 1/2 inch in diameter.

5. With a knife, cut the ropes into 1-inch pieces. Take each piece and roll it gently along the tines of a fork, creating a slight indentation on one side and a ridged surface on the other.

6. Fill a large pot with salted water and bring it to a boil. Add the gnocchi and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the gnocchi.

7. While the gnocchi are cooking, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté until aromatic, about 30 seconds.

8. Pour in the crushed tomatoes and salt, lower the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes.

9. Add the cooked and drained gnocchi to the tomato sauce and toss everything together. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.

10. Serve the gnocchi hot, garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh basil, if desired. Enjoy!

Now that you know how to make fresh, delicious gnocchi from scratch, why not try experimenting with different sauces and toppings? Whether you prefer a classic tomato sauce or something more unique, homemade gnocchi is a versatile and satisfying dish that's sure to impress.
