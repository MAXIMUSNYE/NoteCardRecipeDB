## Instructions

1. To prepare the beef, place the stew meat in a large pot and cover with water. Add the diced onions, vegetable oil, salt, cumin, coriander, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour or until the meat is tender.

2. While the beef is cooking, wash the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak rice in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain.

3. In a separate pot, bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon salt and the soaked, drained rice. Boil rice for 5 minutes, then drain.

4. In a large pot, heat 1/4 cup of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the boiled rice and spread evenly. Sprinkle cinnamon over rice, mix and spread again. Add raisins and almonds in a layer on top of rice, then cover and cook over low heat for 30 minutes or until the rice is cooked through.

5. To prepare the carrots, heat 1/4 cup of oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the carrots and stir-fry for 5 minutes. Add sugar, cinnamon, and cardamom, and continue to stir-fry for 5-7 minutes or until the carrots are tender and caramelized.

6. To serve, spread the rice on a large platter. Spoon the beef and its sauce over the rice, then sprinkle with the caramelized carrots. Enjoy hot!
