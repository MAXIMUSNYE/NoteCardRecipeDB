# Honeycomb Candy Recipe

## Ingredients:

### For the candy:
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Granulated sugar | 1 cup |
| Honey | 1/4 cup |
| Corn syrup | 1/4 cup |
| Baking soda | 1 tablespoon |

### For coating:
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Dark chocolate | 8 oz |
| Vegetable oil | 1 tablespoon |

## Steps:

1. In a large pot, combine sugar, honey and corn syrup. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved.

2. Increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Insert a candy thermometer and cook until the mixture reaches 300Â°F.

3. Remove the pot from the heat and immediately whisk in the baking soda until the mixture becomes foamy and light.

4. Quickly pour the mixture onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow it to spread out and cool completely.

5. Once cooled, use a knife or your hands to crack the honeycomb candy into small pieces.

6. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate and vegetable oil for 30 seconds at a time, stirring in between until fully melted.

7. Dip the honeycomb pieces into the melted chocolate until fully coated and place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.

8. Place the baking sheet in the fridge and allow the chocolate to harden for approximately 15 minutes.

9. Serve and enjoy!
