| 1 lb | boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks |
| 2 tbsp | olive oil |
| 1 tbsp | lemon juice |
| 1 tbsp | minced garlic |
| 1 tsp | dried oregano |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |
| 1/4 tsp | black pepper |

### For the Tzatziki Sauce:

| Quantity | Ingredient  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 cup | plain Greek yogurt |
| 1/2 cup | grated cucumber, drained |
| 1 tbsp | lemon juice |
| 1 tbsp | chopped fresh dill |
| 1/2 tsp | minced garlic |
| 1/2 tsp | salt |

### For Serving:

| 4 | pita breads |
| 1 | sliced red onion |

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and black pepper for the chicken marinade.
2. Add the chicken chunks and toss to coat them evenly. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 8 hours in the refrigerator.
3. Preheat a grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Thread the chicken pieces onto skewers and discard the excess marinade.
4. Grill the chicken skewers for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through.
5. In the meantime, make the tzatziki sauce by mixing together the Greek yogurt, grated cucumber, lemon juice, dill, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl.
6. Heat the pita breads on the grill for 1 minute on each side.
7. To serve, spread some tzatziki sauce on each pita bread, and then add some sliced red onion, chopped tomato, and crumbled feta cheese. Top with the grilled chicken skewers, and sprinkle with some chopped fresh parsley. Fold the pita breads over and serve immediately. Enjoy!
