If you're looking for a sweet and citrusy treat, look no further than candied orange peel! This recipe is simple to make and yields a delicious result that's perfect on its own or as a topping for cakes, ice cream, and more.

## Ingredients

### For the orange peel:

| Quantity | Ingredients |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 4         | Oranges     |
| As needed | Water       |

### For the sugar syrup:

| Quantity   | Ingredients |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 1/2 cups | Granulated sugar |
| 3/4 cup    | Water       |


## Instructions

1. Rinse the oranges and pat them dry with a towel.

2. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the orange peel in long strips. Try to avoid getting too much of the bitter white pith beneath the peel.

3. Slice the strips of peel into thin, uniform pieces.

4. Place the orange peel pieces in a pot and cover with water. 

5. Bring the water to a boil and reduce the heat to low. Let the orange peel simmer for about 10 minutes to help remove some of the bitterness.

6. Drain the orange peel and set aside.

7. In a clean pot, make the sugar syrup by mixing together the granulated sugar and water. 

8. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.

9. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the orange peel to the pot.

10. Reduce the heat to medium and let the orange peel simmer in the syrup for 30-40 minutes, or until the peel becomes translucent and slightly shrivelled.

11. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.

12. Use a slotted spoon to remove the orange peel from the syrup and place it on a wire rack to dry.

13. Let the orange peel dry for a few hours or overnight. Once dry, the candied orange peel can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a month. 

Enjoy your delicious candied orange peel!
