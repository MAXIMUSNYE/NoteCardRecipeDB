3. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing it into thin strips.
4. To assemble the wraps, warm the tortillas in a microwave for 15-20 seconds. Spread 1-2 tablespoons of the Caesar dressing on each tortilla. Add a handful of chopped romaine lettuce and a few slices of chicken on top. Sprinkle some shredded Parmesan cheese over the chicken.
