| Lemon juice  | 2 tbsp   |
| Garlic cloves, minced  | 3 cloves |

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, salt and pepper.

2. Add the beef to the marinade and toss until it is well-coated. Allow it to sit in the marinade for at least 30 minutes (or overnight in the refrigerator for best results).

3. Cut the vegetables into chunks and wedges and put them in a separate bowl.

4. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.

5. Skewer the meat and vegetables onto metal or wooden skewers in an alternating pattern.

6. Brush the skewers with marinade for extra flavor.

7. Grill the kebabs for 10-12 minutes, or until the beef is cooked to your liking, turning them every few minutes to ensure even cooking.

8. Once they are cooked, remove the kebabs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.

9. Enjoy warm and serve with your favorite dipping sauce.
