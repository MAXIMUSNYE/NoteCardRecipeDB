## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Season squabs with salt and black pepper, inside and out.
3. In a large skillet, melt butter and olive oil over medium-high heat.
4. Brown squabs on both sides in the skillet until they turn golden brown. This should take about 5 minutes per side.

8. In a medium saucepan, add the grapes, chicken broth, red wine, minced garlic, cornstarch, honey, salt, and black pepper.
9. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, or until the grapes have burst and the sauce has thickened.
10. Remove the grape sauce from heat and puree it in a blender until smooth. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper.
11. Serve the roasted squabs with grape sauce drizzled over them. Enjoy!
