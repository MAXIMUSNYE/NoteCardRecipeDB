2. Cut the onion and ginger into halves and slightly char them on a hot, dry pan until they have a light char on the cut side.

3. Once the beef bones are done roasting, transfer them to a large stockpot and add enough water to cover them. Bring to the boil, then switch to a low heat and simmer for 10 minutes.

4. Add the charred onion and ginger to the pot. Then add the cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, and cloves.

5. Add the fish sauce, salt, and sugar to the pot. Cover and let it simmer for at least four hours. 

6. Strain the broth and discard the solids. Set the broth aside.

7. Cook the rice noodles according to the package instructions.

8. Slice the beef sirloin into thin strips.

9. Place the bean sprouts, Thai basil leaves, and thin slices of beef sirloin into bowls.

10. Pour the hot beef broth over the top of the beef and herbs.

11. Serve with a lime wedge on the side and hoisin and sriracha sauce on the table.

Enjoy!
