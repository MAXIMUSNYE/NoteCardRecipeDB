# Fresh Fig and Honey Tart Recipe

## Ingredients Required:

### For the Crust:

| Ingredient    | Quantity | 
| ---------- | :-----------: |
| All-purpose flour       | 1 1/2 cups     |
| Granulated sugar   | 2 tbsp   |
| Butter, cold and cubed   | 3/4 cup    |
| Ice water   | 3-4 tbsp    |

### For the Filling:

| Ingredient    | Quantity | 
| ---------- | :-----------: |
| Fresh figs, sliced     | 1 1/2 cups     |
| Honey   | 1/2 cup   |
| Ground cinnamon   | 1 tsp   |
| Cornstarch   | 1 tbsp    |
| Water   | 1 cup    |

## Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and mix using a pastry blender, or your fingers until it resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Gradually add ice water into the flour mixture, and mix until it forms a dough.
4. Shape the dough into a disk and wrap in cling film. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
5. Roll out the pre-chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and transfer it to a 9-inch tart pan. Gently press the dough to cover the bottom and the sides of the pan. Chill for 15 minutes.
6. In a mixing bowl, mix the honey, cinnamon, cornstarch, and water. Whisk until well combined.
7. Arrange the sliced figs in the chilled tart crust. Pour the honey mixture over the figs.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
9. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
10. Slice and serve the fresh fig and honey tart with a dollop of whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Enjoy!
