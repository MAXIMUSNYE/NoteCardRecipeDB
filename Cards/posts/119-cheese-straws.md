## Steps
1. In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and cayenne pepper. 
2. Add in chilled and cubed butter and mix it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs.
3. Add in shredded cheddar cheese and mix well. 
4. Gradually add ice-cold water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing the dough gently with your hands until it comes together.
5. Divide the dough into two equal portions and wrap them in cling film. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. 
7. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes to soften slightly.
8. Roll out the pastry dough to a thickness of 1/4 inch on a lightly floured surface. 
9. Cut the dough into thin strips, about 8 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. 
10. Brush them with egg wash. 
11. In a separate small bowl, mix together toppings: Parmesan cheese, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, smoked paprika, and sea salt.
12. Sprinkle the mixed toppings over the egg-washed strips and gently press them in. 
13. Transfer the strips to the prepared baking sheets, spacing them out about 1/4 inch apart. 
14. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until golden brown. 
15. Serve immediately, or store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.
