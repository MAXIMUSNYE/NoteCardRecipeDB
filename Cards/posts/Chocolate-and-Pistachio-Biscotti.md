# Chocolate and Pistachio Biscotti Recipe

---

## Ingredients:

#### For the Biscotti:
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| All-purpose flour | 2 cups |
| Baking powder | 1 1/2 tsp |
| Salt | 1/4 tsp |
| Unsalted butter, at room temperature | 1/2 cup |
| Granulated sugar | 1 cup |
| Large eggs | 2 |
| Vanilla extract | 1 tsp |
| Pistachios, roughly chopped | 1 cup |
| Semisweet chocolate chips | 1 cup |

#### For the Chocolate Drizzle:
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Semisweet chocolate chips | 1/2 cup |
| Unsalted butter | 1 tbsp |

## Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.

3. In a separate large bowl, use an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add in the eggs, one at a time, and beat well after each addition. Mix in the vanilla extract.

4. Gradually mix in the flour mixture until just combined.

5. Fold in the pistachios and chocolate chips.

6. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a log about 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. Place the logs onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 3 inches apart.

7. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the logs are firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.

8. Using a serrated knife, slice each log on the diagonal into 1/2 inch slices.  Arrange the slices upright on the baking sheet and bake for another 25 minutes, or until the biscotti are crisp and golden. 

9. For the chocolate drizzle, melt the chocolate chips and butter together in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until smooth.

10. Drizzle or spread the melted chocolate over the cooled biscotti.

11. Allow the chocolate to set before serving. Enjoy!
