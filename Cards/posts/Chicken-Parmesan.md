## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them to an even thickness, about 1/2 inch.
3. Season the chicken with salt and pepper.
4. Set up three shallow dishes: a first one with all-purpose flour, a second one with two whisked eggs, and a third one with a mix of breadcrumbs, grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
5. Coat each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess, then dip them in the eggs and coat them with the breadcrumb mixture.
6. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
7. Once the oil is hot, add the breaded chicken and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until golden brown.
8. Remove the chicken cutlets from the skillet and place them on a baking sheet.
9. In a separate saucepan, combine all the tomato sauce ingredients and bring to a simmer.
10. Pour a generous amount of the tomato sauce on top of each chicken cutlet and sprinkle with shredded mozzarella and grated parmesan cheese.
11. Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
12. Serve hot, garnished with freshly chopped basil leaves. Enjoy!
