# Simple Duck Prosciutto Recipe

## Ingredients

| Component          | Ingredient             | Amount   |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Duck Breast         | Boneless duck breast    | 1 lb     |
| Cure                | Coarse sea salt         | 1/4 cup |
|                     | Light brown sugar      | 1/4 cup |
|                     | Pink curing salt (#1)  | 1/2 tsp |
| Flavorings         | Freshly ground black pepper   | 1 tsp |
|                     | Fresh thyme            | 4 sprigs |
|                     | Fresh rosemary         | 2 sprigs |


## Steps

1. In a small bowl, mix together the cure ingredients.
2. Rinse the duck breast under cold water and pat it dry.
3. On a flat surface, sprinkle half of the mixture in an even layer.
4. Place the duck breast on top of the cure mixture, skin side down.
5. Sprinkle the remaining mixture over the top of the duck breast, until it's completely covered.
6. Add the ground black pepper, thyme, and rosemary evenly on top of the cure mixture.
7. Place the duck in a resealable bag and seal, removing as much of the air as possible.
8. Refrigerate the bag in a container for 7 days. Flip the bag over every other day to ensure proper curing.
9. After 7 days, remove the breast from the bag, and using paper towels, gently brush off any excess cure mixture and herbs.
10. Wrap the breast tightly with cheesecloth and string, and hang it in a cool, dry, and dark place for 2-3 weeks. 
11. Once the duck is ready, slice it thinly and enjoy! The prosciutto will keep for several weeks if stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container. 

Enjoy your homemade Duck Prosciutto!
