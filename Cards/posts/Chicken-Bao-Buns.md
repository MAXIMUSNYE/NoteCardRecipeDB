## Instructions

1. Cut the chicken breasts into small pieces and put them in a bowl.
2. Add the five-spice powder, minced garlic, grated ginger, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, cornstarch, sesame oil, and vegetable oil to the bowl. Mix well to coat the chicken.
3. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until fully cooked and crispy. Add the water and cook for another minute while stirring, until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is completely coated.
4. Remove the chicken from heat and set it aside.
5. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, yeast, sugar, warm water, and vegetable oil until a dough forms.
6. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes on a floured surface until it is smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rise for 30 minutes in a warm place.
7. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a circle and place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center.
8. Gather the edges of the dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bun. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.
9. Place each bun on a small piece of parchment paper and let them rest for 15 minutes.
10. While waiting, bring a pot of water to a boil. Place a steamer basket over the water.
11. Put the buns in the steamer basket, leaving space between them so they don't stick together. Cover and steam for 12-15 minutes, or until the buns are puffed up and fully cooked.
12. Serve hot with the sliced scallions, chopped cilantro, and hoisin sauce. Enjoy your delicious Chicken Bao Buns!
