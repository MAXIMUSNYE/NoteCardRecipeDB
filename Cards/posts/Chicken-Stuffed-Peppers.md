Here's a recipe for delicious chicken stuffed peppers that are easy to make and will satisfy your cravings. Let's get started!

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken:

| Ingredient | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Chicken breast | 2 pcs |
| Olive oil | 1 tbsp |
| Onion powder | 1 tsp |
| Garlic powder | 1 tsp |
| Salt | 1/2 tsp |
| Black pepper | 1/2 tsp |

### For the Peppers:

| Ingredient | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Bell peppers | 4 pcs |
| Cooked rice | 1 cup |
| Tomato sauce | 1/2 cup |
| Cheddar cheese | 1 cup |
| Green onions | 2 pcs |
| Salt | 1/2 tsp |
| Black pepper | 1/2 tsp |

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375Â°F.

2. Season the chicken breasts on both sides with olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and black pepper. Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the chicken for 5-7 minutes per side or until fully cooked. Transfer the chicken to a bowl and let it cool down.

3. Once the chicken is cooled, shred it into small pieces and set it aside.

4. Cut the tops off of the bell peppers and remove the seeds and white membranes from the inside.

5. Combine the cooked rice, tomato sauce, shredded chicken, cheddar cheese, green onions, salt and black pepper in a mixing bowl. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.

6. Stuff the filling mixture into each bell pepper. Don't overfill them as the rice will expand while cooking.

7. Place the stuffed peppers on a baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.

8. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the peppers are soft and tender.

9. Remove the aluminum foil and sprinkle some more cheddar cheese on top of each pepper. Bake for 5-7 more minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

10. Remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.

Enjoy your delicious Chicken Stuffed Peppers!
