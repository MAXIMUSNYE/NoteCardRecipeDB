## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. In a large saucepan, cook the chicken breasts in boiling water for 15-20 minutes or until cooked through. Remove from heat, let cool, and cut into bite-size pieces.
3. In a large skillet, sauté the onion and carrots in butter until the onion is translucent. Add in peas and cooked chicken. Stir until evenly combined.
4. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.
5. Gradually add in chicken broth, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil and thickens.
6. Add salt and pepper to taste.
7. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, and butter to make the pie crust. Mix well until the mixture is crumbly.
8. Add cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until the mixture is moist and comes together to form a ball.
9. Roll out half of the pastry dough and place it in a greased 9-inch pie dish.
10. Pour the chicken mixture into the pie dish.
11. Roll out the remaining pastry dough and cover the pie dish with the dough. Crimp the edges and make small slits in the top of the dough to allow steam to escape.
12. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.
13. Let the chicken pot pie cool for a few minutes before serving.

Enjoy!
