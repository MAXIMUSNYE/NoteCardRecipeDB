# Chicken Potstickers Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the filling:

| Quantity | Ingredient   |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 pound   | ground chicken |
| 1/2 cup   | shredded cabbage |
| 2 cloves  | garlic, minced |
| 2 teaspoons | soy sauce |
| 1 teaspoon  | sesame oil |
| 1/4 teaspoon | black pepper |
| 1 tablespoon | vegetable oil |

### For the wrapper:

| Quantity | Ingredient   |
|----------|--------------|
| 2 cups   | all-purpose flour |
| 1/2 cup   | hot water |

### For the dipping sauce:

| Quantity | Ingredient   |
|----------|--------------|
| 1/4 cup  | soy sauce |
| 2 tablespoons | rice vinegar |
| 1 tablespoon | brown sugar |
| 1/2 teaspoon | sesame oil |
| 1 tablespoon | sliced scallion (optional) |

## Steps

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine ground chicken, shredded cabbage, minced garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, black pepper, and vegetable oil. Mix everything well using your hands.
2. In a separate bowl, mix all-purpose flour with hot water and knead the dough until it is smooth and pliable. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and set aside for 30 minutes.
3. Dust a clean surface with flour, and roll the dough into a long and thin log, cut it into small pieces (about 1-ounce). Use your palms to flatten the dough into circles, about 3 inches in diameter.
4. Place a tablespoon of filling in the center of each wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half, and then seal the edges by pinching them together.
5. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the potstickers in a single layer, and cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
6. Add 1/4 cup of water into the frying pan, then immediately cover the pan with a lid. Let the dumplings steam over medium-low heat for 5 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed. Remove the lid and continue to cook until the potstickers are crisp and browned underneath.
7. While the potstickers are cooking, mix soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, sesame oil, and sliced scallion together for the dipping sauce.
8. Serve the potstickers hot with dipping sauce on the side. Enjoy!
