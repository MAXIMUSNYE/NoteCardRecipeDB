## Instructions

### Making the Pastry Cream

1. In a medium saucepan, heat the whole milk over medium heat until it starts to simmer around the edges of the pan.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, granulated sugar, and corn starch until smooth.
3. Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisk constantly.
4. Pour the entire mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the pastry cream is thickened.
5. Remove from heat and stir in the unsalted butter and vanilla extract.
6. Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl, cover, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until ready to use.

### Making the Pâte à Choux

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium saucepan, bring water, butter, sugar and salt to a boil.
3. Add the flour and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until the mixture forms into a ball.
4. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and allow it to cool slightly, about 5 minutes.
5. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. The batter should be smooth.
6. Use a piping bag fitted with a large round tip to pipe 1-inch balls onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch apart. 
7. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the puffs are golden brown.
8. Remove from the oven and let them cool before filling.

### Filling the Puffs

1. Use a sharp serrated knife to carefully slice off the tops of the puffs.
2. Fill them with the prepared pastry cream using a piping bag fitted with a small round tip.
3. Replace the tops of the puffs.

### Assembling the Croquembouche

1. Dip the bottom of each filled puff into the caramel glaze and allow any excess caramel to drip off.
2. Use melted caramel to stick each puff to a foam cone or tower stand, starting from the bottom and working up.
3. Continue sticking the puffs around the cone or tower stand until you have completely covered it.
4. Drizzle with remaining caramel glaze and serve immediately.

Enjoy the impressive beauty and delicious taste of your homemade Croquembouche!
