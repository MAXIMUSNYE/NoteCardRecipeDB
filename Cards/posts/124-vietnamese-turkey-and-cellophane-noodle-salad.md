## Steps

1. In a large bowl, combine the ground turkey, minced garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar, fish sauce, and vegetable oil. Stir well to coat the turkey evenly with the sauce mixture.

3. While the turkey is cooking, soak the cellophane noodles in boiling water for 10 minutes, or until they are soft and pliable. Drain the water and rinse the noodles with cold water. Set aside.

4. In a large salad bowl, combine the shredded carrots, sliced cucumber, chopped mint leaves, chopped cilantro leaves, and chopped peanuts.

5. Add the cooked turkey and softened cellophane noodles to the salad bowl.

6. To make the dressing, whisk together the lime juice, rice vinegar, brown sugar, fish sauce, minced garlic, and sliced red chili pepper in a separate bowl.

7. Drizzle the dressing over the salad, and toss well to combine.

8. Serve the Vietnamese turkey and cellophane noodle salad immediately, garnished with additional chopped peanuts, if desired. Enjoy!
