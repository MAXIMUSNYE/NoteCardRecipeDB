## Ingredients
### Dry Ingredients
| Amount | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 1 3/4 cups | All-purpose flour |
| 1 teaspoon | Baking powder |
| 1/2 teaspoon | Baking soda |
| 1/2 teaspoon | Salt |

### Wet Ingredients
| Amount | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 1/2 cup | Unsalted butter, melted |
| 1 cup | Granulated sugar |
| 2 | Large eggs |
| 1 teaspoon | Vanilla extract |
| 3 ripe bananas, mashed |

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine all dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.

3. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together melted butter and sugar until well combined. Add eggs, vanilla extract, and mashed bananas. Mix well.

4. Gradually fold in the dry mixture into the wet mixture until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

5. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.

6. Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.

7. Remove the banana bread from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes in the pan.

8. After 10 minutes, gently remove the bread from the loaf pan and transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. Slice and serve! Enjoy your freshly baked banana bread with a cup of tea or coffee.

Note: You can store leftover banana bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. For longer storage, wrap the bread tightly in plastic wrap and store in the fridge for up to a week. You can also freeze the banana bread for up to 3 months.
