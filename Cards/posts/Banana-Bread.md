## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|---|---|
| All-purpose flour | 2 cups |
| Baking powder | 1 teaspoon |
| Baking soda | 1/2 teaspoon |
| Salt | 1/2 teaspoon|

### Wet Ingredients
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Ripe bananas, mashed | 3 |
| Granulated sugar | 3/4 cup |
| Large egg | 1 |
| Unsweetened applesauce | 1/4 cup |
| Vegetable oil | 1/4 cup |
| Vanilla extract | 1 teaspoon |

## Steps 
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C)
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt) until combined.
3. In a separate bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until they turn into a smooth paste. Add granulated sugar, a large egg, unsweetened applesauce, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract and whisk everything together until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
4. Add the dry ingredient mixture to the banana mixture and mix everything until the batter is just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
5. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or cooking spray and pour the batter into it.
6. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.
7. Once cooked, remove from oven and let the banana bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing it to a wire rack to cool completely.
8. Slice and enjoy your delicious homemade Banana Bread!

Note: If you want to add some extra flavor, try adding chocolate chips or chopped nuts to the batter.
