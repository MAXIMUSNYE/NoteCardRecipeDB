# Eggplant Parmesan Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Eggplant Parmesan

| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Eggplants | 2 |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Bread Crumbs | 1 1/2 cups |
| Grated Parmesan Cheese | 1/2 cup |
| Egg | 1 |
| All-Purpose Flour | 1/2 cup |
| Olive Oil | 1/2 cup |
| Tomato Sauce | 2 cups |
| Mozzarella Cheese | 2 cups |

### For the Tomato Sauce

| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Olive Oil | 2 tbsp |
| Chopped Onion | 1 |
| Chopped Garlic Cloves | 2 |
| Italian Seasoning | 1 tsp |
| Crushed Tomatoes | 28 oz |
| Salt | 1/2 tsp |
| Sugar | 1 tsp |


## Instructions

1. Slice the eggplants crosswise into 1/4 inch thick rounds.
2. Sprinkle salt on the eggplant slices and let them sit for 30 minutes to release excess moisture.
3. Rinse the eggplant slices and pat them dry with paper towels.
4. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
5. In a shallow dish, mix bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese.
6. Beat the egg in a separate shallow dish, and place all-purpose flour in another shallow plate.
7. Dip each eggplant slice into the flour, shaking off any excess. Then, dip it in the beaten egg, and coat it with the breadcrumb mixture. Set aside.
8. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the eggplant slices in batches and fry until golden brown on both sides. Remove from the skillet and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.
9. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat, add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent for about 5 minutes.
10. Add the chopped garlic, Italian seasoning, crushed tomatoes, salt, and sugar. Cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
11. Spread a layer of tomato sauce in the bottom of a baking dish. Layer the fried eggplant on top of the sauce, then pour the remaining tomato sauce over the eggplant.
12. Sprinkle grated mozzarella cheese generously over the tomato sauce, then bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
13. Serve hot and enjoy your delicious eggplant parmesan!

*Note: If you'd like a crispier texture, place the fried eggplant on a baking sheet and bake for 5-10 minutes before layering them in the baking dish.
