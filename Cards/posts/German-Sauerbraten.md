## Instructions

1. Combine all marinade ingredients in a large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer for 5 minutes.

2. Let the marinade cool to room temperature.

3. Place the beef cubes in a large bowl or container and pour the marinade over the meat. Make sure the meat is completely submerged in the marinade.

4. Cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days, turning the meat every day to make sure it's evenly coated.

5. Once the meat has marinated, remove it from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels.

6. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

7. In a large Dutch oven or oven-safe pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

8. Add the beef cubes and brown them on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side.

9. Pour the marinade over the beef and bring it to a simmer.

10. Cover the Dutch oven with a lid and place it in the oven.

11. Cook the beef for about 3 hours, or until the meat is very tender and falls apart easily.

12. Remove the beef from the pot and set it aside.

13. Strain the cooking liquid through a fine-mesh strainer into a saucepan.

14. Add the water, cornstarch, raisins, brown sugar, red wine vinegar, diced apple, chopped onion, and bay leaves to the saucepan.

15. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat.

16. Cook the sauce, stirring occasionally, until it thickens, about 10-15 minutes.

17. Remove the bay leaves from the sauce.

18. Add the crumbled gingersnap cookies to the sauce and stir until they dissolve.

19. Serve the beef with the sauce spooned over the top. Enjoy!
