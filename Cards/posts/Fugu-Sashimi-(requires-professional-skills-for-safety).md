# Fugu Sashimi Recipe

**Note:** Fugu, or blowfish, is a delicacy in Japan. However, it contains potent toxins that can be deadly if not prepared correctly. This recipe is intended for professional chefs with extensive knowledge and training. 

## Ingredients

### For the Fugu Sashimi

| Quantity | Ingredient|
|---------|-----------|
| 1 pound | Fresh Fugu Fish |
| As needed | Wasabi |
| As needed | Soy Sauce |
| As needed | Daikon (Japanese Radish) |
| As needed | Scallions |

### For the Rice

| Quantity | Ingredient|
|---------|-----------|
| 1 cup | Japanese Rice |
| 1 1/4 cups | Water |
| 1 tablespoon | Rice Vinegar |
| 1 tablespoon | Sugar |
| 1 teaspoon | Salt |

## Preparation

1. Begin by preparing the rice. Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear, and then drain off the excess water.

2. Add the rinsed rice and 1 1/4 cups of water to a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat.

3. Once the water starts boiling, reduce the heat to low, and cover the saucepan with a lid. Let the rice cook for 18-20 minutes or until tender.

4. Remove the saucepan from the heat, and let it sit for 10 minutes with the lid on.

5. In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.

6. After 10 minutes, fluff the rice with a fork, and add the vinegar mixture to the rice. Mix well, and let it cool to room temperature.

7. Next, prepare the fugu fish. Rinse it thoroughly with cold water, and pat it dry with paper towels.

8. Using a sharp fillet knife, remove the skin and bones from the fish. Cut the fish into thin slices, and arrange them on a large plate.

9. Serve the fugu sashimi with separate bowls of soy sauce and wasabi. Thinly slice the daikon and scallions, and use them as garnish for the fish. 

10. Serve the rice in a separate bowl alongside the fugu sashimi, and enjoy!

**Note:** Always exercise extreme caution when handling and preparing fugu fish. If you are not a professional chef with extensive knowledge and training, do not attempt to prepare fugu sashimi at home.
