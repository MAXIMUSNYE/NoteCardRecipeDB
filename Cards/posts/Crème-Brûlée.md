# Crème Brûlée Recipe

Crème Brûlée is a classic French dessert that is popular all over the world. This silky smooth custard topped with a crispy caramel crust is a heavenly indulgence that everyone will love. Here's an easy recipe that you can try at home.

## Ingredients
### Custard
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4        | Egg yolks  |
| 1/3 cup  | Granulated sugar |
| 1 1/2 cups | Heavy cream |
| 1 teaspoon | Vanilla extract |

### Caramelized Sugar
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1/3 cup | Granulated sugar |

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture turns pale yellow.
3. In a small saucepan, heat the heavy cream until it's steaming, but do not let it boil. Add vanilla extract to the cream and stir to blend with a whisk.
4. Pour the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture in a steady stream while whisking continuously. Mix until well combined.
5. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove any lumps.
6. Pour the custard mixture into four ramekins or custard cups, filling each one about three-quarters full.
7. Place the ramekins into a baking dish with enough hot water to come up halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
8. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until the custard is set around the edges but still jiggles slightly in the center when shaken.
9. Remove the ramekins from the water bath and allow them to cool to room temperature. Then, chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
10. Before serving, sprinkle one tablespoon of sugar on top of each custard.
11. Using a kitchen torch, caramelize the sugar until it turns golden brown and forms a crispy top. If you don't have a torch, you can use the broiler of your oven.
12. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious Crème Brûlée.
