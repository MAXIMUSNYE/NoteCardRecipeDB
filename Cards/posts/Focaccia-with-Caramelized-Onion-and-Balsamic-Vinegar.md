| Active dry yeast | 1 packet (2 1/2 tsp) |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Olive oil | 1/4 cup |
| Warm water | 1 1/4 cups |

#### Caramelized Onions

### Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and salt for the dough. Mix well.

2. Add the olive oil and warm water into the mixing bowl. Mix until the dough forms.

3. Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Knead the dough until it becomes elastic, about 5 to 7 minutes.

4. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Let it rise for 1 to 2 hours until it doubles in size.

5. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.

6. In a pan over medium-low heat, add the olive oil for the caramelized onions.

7. Slice the onions thinly. Add them to the pan along with the salt. Stir the onions occasionally until they turn golden brown and caramelized.

8. In a saucepan, combine balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, olive oil, and salt for the balsamic glaze. Cook over medium heat until the mixture thickens.

9. Punch down the dough and transfer it to a greased baking sheet.

10. Top the dough with the caramelized onions, spreading them evenly.

11. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the focaccia is golden brown.

12. Remove from the oven and drizzle the balsamic glaze over the warm focaccia.

13. Slice the Focaccia into pieces and serve warm.
