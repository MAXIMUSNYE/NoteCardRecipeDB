## Directions

1. In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, and salt. Add the chicken thighs, and toss to coat. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours.

2. In a large skillet or dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of oil. Add the chicken thighs to the pan, and cook for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until browned all over. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. In the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil, and saute the onion, garlic, and ginger together until the onion is translucent and fragrant. Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, and garam masala and cook until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.

4. Add the tomato puree to the pan and stir well to combine. Let cook for about 2-3 minutes, or until the tomato puree has darkened in color. Add the water to the pan and stir well to combine.

5. Return the chicken to the pan and stir to cover in the sauce. Simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked through.

6. Pour in the coconut milk and stir well to combine. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and creamy.

7. Serve the Chicken Korma hot with rice and naan bread on the side. Enjoy!
