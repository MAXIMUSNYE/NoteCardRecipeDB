3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and butter until light and fluffy.
5. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.
6. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.
7. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
8. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake.
9. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes before turning them onto a wire rack to cool completely.

10. For the custard, heat the milk and salt in a saucepan over medium heat.
11. In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch, then whisk in the beaten egg yolks.
12. Gradually whisk the hot milk into the egg yolk mixture.
13. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes or until thickened.
14. Remove the custard from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract.
15. Transfer the custard to a bowl and place in the refrigerator to cool.

16. To make the chocolate glaze, sift together the cocoa powder and powdered sugar into a medium bowl.
17. In a small saucepan, heat the milk and butter over medium heat until the butter is melted.
18. Gradually whisk the milk mixture into the cocoa mixture until smooth. 

19. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer onto a serving plate.
20. Spread the custard over the top of the cake.
21. Place the second cake layer on top of the custard.
