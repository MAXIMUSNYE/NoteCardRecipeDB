## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Make the sponge cake: Separate egg whites from yolks. Beat yolks in a large mixing bowl until thick and lemon-colored. Gradually beat in sugar and vanilla extract until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and baking powder. Gradually fold flour mixture into egg mixture.
3. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gradually fold egg whites into the flour-egg mixture.
4. Pour mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Allow it to cool completely.
5. Once cool, use a round cookie cutter to cut out circles from the sponge cake.
6. Make the ice cream: Take ice cream out of the freezer and allow it to sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes to soften. Mix vanilla ice cream and chocolate ice cream in a bowl. Add chopped walnuts and stir well. Pour mixture into a greased 8-inch cake pan. Cover with foil and freeze for at least 2 hours.
7. Preheat oven to 425°F. Beat egg whites and cream of tartar together until soft peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar until stiff and glossy. 
8. Remove the ice cream from the freezer and remove the foil cover. Place sponge cake circles on top of the ice cream, pressing down slightly. Place it back in the freezer for 5 minutes.
9. Remove ice cream from the freezer and spread meringue generously all over the ice cream, covering sponge cake and ice cream. Use a spoon to create peaks in the meringue.
10. Sprinkle sugar on top of the meringue and bake in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the meringue is golden brown.
11. Remove from oven and serve immediately or return to the freezer until ready to serve.
12. Enjoy your delicious Baked Alaska!
