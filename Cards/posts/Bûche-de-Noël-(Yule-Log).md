## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

2. Using a sieve, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.

3. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.

4. Add the vanilla extract and continue to beat until well combined.

5. Gradually add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and stir until just combined.

6. Pour the batter onto the prepared baking sheet and spread evenly.

7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cake is firm to the touch.

8. While the cake is baking, prepare the filling. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it begins to simmer.

9. Remove from heat and add the chocolate chips and butter. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.

10. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract and stir until well combined.

11. Once the cake is finished baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.

12. Dust the cake with confectioners' sugar, then place a fresh piece of parchment paper on top of the cake.

13. Place a clean kitchen towel on top of the parchment paper, then flip the cake over onto the towel.

14. Carefully remove the parchment paper from the bottom of the cake. Spread the chocolate filling on top of the cake, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges.

15. Starting at one end, tightly roll the cake into a log shape. Place the log seam-side down on a serving platter.

16. Prepare the frosting by heating the heavy cream in a saucepan over medium heat until it begins to simmer.

17. Remove from heat and add the chocolate chips and butter. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.

18. Add the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract and stir until well combined.

19. Let the frosting cool to room temperature, then pour it over the log.

20. Use a fork or knife to create "bark" marks on the frosting.

21. Serve and enjoy the delicious Bûche de Noël!
