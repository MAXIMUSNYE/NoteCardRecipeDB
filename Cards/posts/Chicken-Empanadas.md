## Ingredients

### For the Dough
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Flour      | 2 cups   |
| Salt       | 1 tsp    |
| Baking Powder | 1 tsp  |
| Cold Butter  | 1/2 cup |
| Cold Water   | 1/2 cup |

### For the Filling
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Chicken Breast | 1 lb |
| Olive Oil | 2 tbsp |
| Onion, finely chopped | 1 |
| Garlic, minced | 2 cloves |
| Cumin | 1 tsp |
| Smoked Paprika | 1/2 tsp |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Black Pepper | 1/2 tsp |
| Tomato Sauce | 1/2 cup |
| Green Olives, sliced | 1/2 cup |
| Raisins | 1/2 cup |

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and baking powder.
3. Add the cold butter to the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or a fork to blend until the mixture resembles coarse meal.
4. Add the cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix until a dough forms.
5. Knead the dough lightly on a floured surface for 1-2 minutes until smooth.
6. Divide the dough into 8 equal-sized balls and refrigerate them while you make the filling.
7. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
8. Add the chopped onion and stir until it becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds.
9. Add the chicken breast, cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Cook until the chicken is browned on all sides, about 6-8 minutes.
10. Add the tomato sauce, green olives, and raisins to the skillet and stir until fully combined. Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool.
11. On a floured surface, roll out each dough ball into a 6-inch circle.
12. Place 2 tablespoons of the chicken filling in the center of each dough circle and fold the dough over to enclose the filling, forming a half-moon shape.
13. Use a fork to crimp the edges of the empanadas shut.
14. Place the empanadas on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.
15. Let the empanadas cool for 5 minutes before serving.

Enjoy your delicious Chicken Empanadas!
