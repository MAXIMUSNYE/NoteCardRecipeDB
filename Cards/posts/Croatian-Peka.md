# Croatian Peka Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Meat
| Ingredients | Quantity |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Lamb, beef, or pork | 2 lbs |
| Onion | 1 large |
| Garlic | 3 cloves |
| Olive oil | 1/4 cup |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Pepper | 1/2 tsp |

### For the Potatoes and Vegetables
| Ingredients | Quantity |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Potatoes | 2 lbs |
| Red bell pepper | 1 large |
| Green bell pepper | 1 large |
| Zucchini | 1 large |
| Eggplant | 1 large |
| Olive oil | 1/4 cup |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Pepper | 1/2 tsp |

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces, and place them in a large mixing bowl.
3. Chop the onion and garlic, then add them to the mixing bowl with the meat.
4. Add olive oil, salt, and pepper to the mixing bowl with the meat mixture, and mix well.
5. Place the meat mixture in a large roasting pan or baking dish, covering it with a lid or foil.
6. Place the roasting pan or baking dish in the preheated oven and bake it for 45 minutes.
7. Cut the potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, and eggplant into bite-sized pieces and place them in a large mixing bowl.
8. Add olive oil, salt, and pepper to the mixing bowl with the vegetables, and mix well.
9. After the 45 minutes have passed, remove the roasting pan from the oven and add the vegetables around the meat mixture, ensuring they are evenly distributed.
10. Cover the pan tightly with a lid or foil, then return it to the oven and bake for an additional hour.
11. Check that the potatoes and meat are fully cooked by piercing them with a fork - if they are soft and tender, they are ready to be served.
12. Serve the Peka hot, either directly from the roasting pan or transferred to a large serving platter.
