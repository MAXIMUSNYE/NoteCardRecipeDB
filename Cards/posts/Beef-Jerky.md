4. Add the beef strips into the marinade and mix well to coat evenly.
5. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.
6. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the beef strips onto the sheet, making sure there is no overlapping or touching.
7. Bake the beef jerky in the preheated oven until it is chewy and dark brown, this should take approximately 4-6 hours.
8. Check the jerky every hour or so and remove any pieces that are ready, letting the others continue to cook.
9. Once finished, remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow the beef jerky to cool to room temperature.
10. Serve immediately or store in an air-tight container for up to 2 weeks.
