# Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients

| Ingredients     | Quantity |
|-----------------|----------|
| All-purpose flour | 2 1/4 cups |
| Baking soda | 1 tsp |
| Salt | 1 tsp |

### Wet Ingredients

| Ingredients     | Quantity |
|-----------------|----------|
| Unsalted butter, softened | 1 cup |
| White granulated sugar | 3/4 cup |
| Brown sugar | 3/4 cup |
| Pure vanilla extract | 2 tsp |
| Large egg | 2 pcs |
| Chocolate chips | 2 cups |

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Start by combining the dry ingredients in a medium-sized bowl. Sift the flour and add in the baking soda and salt. Mix well and set aside.
3. In a separate, larger bowl, cream the softened butter, white granulated sugar, brown sugar, and pure vanilla extract together until creamy and smooth.
4. Add the eggs and mix again until well combined.
5. Slowly add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture. Mix until all ingredients are well combined and a smooth dough is formed.
6. Add the chocolate chips and stir until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
7. Grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spoon or scoop rounded tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, placing them about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden.
9. Remove from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
10. Serve the chocolate chip cookies and enjoy! 

*Note: This recipe makes approximately 24 cookies. Store them in an airtight container for up to 5 days.*
