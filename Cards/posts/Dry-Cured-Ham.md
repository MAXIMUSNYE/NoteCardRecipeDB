3. Rub the mixture all over the pork leg or shoulder, making sure to coat it evenly.

4. Place the meat into a large zip-top bag and seal it. Place it into a container and refrigerate it for 1 week. Flip the bag over every day to evenly distribute the cure.

5. After a week, remove the meat from the bag and rinse it thoroughly under cold water. Pat it dry with paper towels.

6. In a separate bowl, mix together 1 pound of kosher salt, 8 ounces of granulated sugar, 2 ounces of Prague powder #2, and 2 tablespoons of black pepper.

7. Rub the mixture all over the meat, making sure to coat it evenly. Place it into a clean, large zip-top bag and seal it.

8. Place the meat into a container and refrigerate it for another week. Flip the bag over every day to evenly distribute the cure.

9. After the second week, remove the meat from the bag and rinse it thoroughly under cold water. Pat it dry with paper towels.

10. Let the meat hang in a cool, dry place for around 6-10 months until it has lost about 30% of its weight.

11. Enjoy your homemade dry-cured ham!
