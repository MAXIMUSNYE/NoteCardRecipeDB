# Artisan Baguette Recipe

Nothing beats the aroma of freshly baked bread, especially when it's a crusty, delicious baguette. This recipe is simple, but requires a bit of patience during the proofing process. L'art de la baguette!

## Ingredients

### Starter

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Bread flour | 1/2 cup (63g) |
| Water | 1/3 cup (80ml) |
| Instant yeast | 1/16 tsp (0.5g) |

### Dough

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Bread flour | 2 cups (250g) |
| Water | 3/4 cup (180ml) |
| Instant yeast | 1/4 tsp (1g) |
| Salt | 1 1/2 tsp (6g) |

## Steps

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the starter ingredients together until smooth. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest in a warm place for at least 12 hours. 
2. After 12 hours, the starter should have doubled in size and look bubbly. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the dough ingredients together until no more dry flour remains. 
3. Mix the starter with the dough using a stand mixer or by hand. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes until it becomes elastic and soft. 
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rest in a warm place for 1 hour or until it doubles in size. 
5. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C) with a baking stone or cast-iron skillet. 
6. Once the dough has doubled in size, transfer it onto a floured surface, and divide it into equal parts. 
7. Roll each part of the dough into a baguette shape, about 14 inches (35cm) long. 
8. Place the baguettes onto a floured couche or parchment paper. Cover with a towel and let them rest for 30 minutes. 
9. Using a sharp knife or blade, score the baguettes diagonally. 
10. Transfer the baguettes onto the baking stone or skillet. Spray them with water to create steam inside the oven. 
11. Bake the baguettes for 20-25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and crispy. 
12. Let the baguettes cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before serving. Slice and enjoy! 

Baking bread can be intimidating, but this artisan baguette recipe is relatively easy for all bakers to follow. The aroma is wonderful and the end result will leave you feeling accomplished. Bon appétit!
