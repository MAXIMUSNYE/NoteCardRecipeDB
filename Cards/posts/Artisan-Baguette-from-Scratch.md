## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast.
2. Add the warm water to the bowl and mix with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together.
3. Use your hands to knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.
4. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for about 1 hour until it has doubled in size.
5. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
6. Transfer the dough to a floured surface and divide it into 2-3 equal pieces.
7. Shape each piece into a baguette by rolling it out into a long, thin cylinder. Taper the ends of each baguette if desired.
8. Place the baguettes onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
9. In a small bowl, mix together the cornmeal and bread flour. Dust the tops of the baguettes with this mixture.
10. Use a sharp knife to score the top of each baguette 2-3 times diagonally.
11. Bake the baguettes in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until golden brown and crispy.
12. Remove the baguettes from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
