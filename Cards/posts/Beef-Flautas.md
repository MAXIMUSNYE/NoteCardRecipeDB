## Steps:

1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.

3. Add the ground beef to the skillet, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon and cook until it is browned, about 5 minutes.
4. Stir in the tomato paste, cumin powder, paprika powder, and salt and pepper seasoning mix. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the ingredients are well combined.
5. Reduce the heat to low and let the beef filling cool.
6. Warm the corn tortillas in the microwave for 30 seconds or by placing them on a skillet for a couple of minutes.
7. Fill each tortilla with the beef filling and roll it tightly into a flauta.
8. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
9. Once the oil is hot, place the flautas seam side down in the skillet and cook until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side.
10. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce or toppings. Enjoy!
