## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 degrees C).

7. Add the chicken broth and continue to cook until the mixture has reduced by half and has a syrup-like consistency.

8. Remove the mixture from the heat and whisk in the butter until fully incorporated.

10. Once the duck is fully roasted, let it rest for 10 minutes before carving into portions.

11. Serve the duck with the orange sauce drizzled over the top.
