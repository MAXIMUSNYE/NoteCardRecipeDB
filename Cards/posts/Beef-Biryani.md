## Instructions

1. In a bowl, mix together yogurt, ginger paste, garlic paste, salt, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and garam masala powder to make a marinade. Add the beef cubes to the marinade, mix well, cover and let it marinate for at least 2 hours.
2. In a large pot, rinse the basmati rice until the water runs clear and soak it in water for at least 30 minutes.
3. Add the water, salt, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, green cardamoms, and cloves to a pot and bring it to a boil. Drain the soaked basmati rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook for about 7-8 minutes or until the rice is cooked but still firm. Drain the rice and set it aside.
4. In a separate pan, heat the oil and add the sliced onions. Fry until the onions are golden brown and crispy. Remove the onions from the pan and set them aside on a paper towel to drain excess oil.
5. In the same pan, add the marinated beef and cook until it is browned and tender. Remove the beef from the pan and set it aside.
6. In the same pan, add the chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes are soft and pulpy.
7. Add half of the cooked rice to the pan and mix well with the tomato mixture. Layer the beef on top of the rice and then add the remaining rice on top of the beef. 
8. Sprinkle the fried onions, chopped mint leaves, and coriander leaves on top of the rice. Pour the saffron milk over the rice.
9. Cover the pan tightly with a lid and cook on low heat for about 10-15 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and fluffy.
10. Serve hot with raita or chutney on the side.

Enjoy your mouth-watering beef biryani!
