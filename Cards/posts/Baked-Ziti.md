## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon of salt to the water and stir to dissolve. Add the ziti pasta and cook until al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain the pasta and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking.
3. In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add 3 cloves of minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add 28 ounces of tomato sauce, 28 ounces of crushed tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of dried basil, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.
4. In a large bowl, mix together 15 ounces of ricotta cheese and 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese.
5. In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread 1/3 of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish. Add 1/2 of the cooked ziti pasta on top of the sauce. Top the pasta with 1/2 of the cheese mixture. Repeat these layers, ending with a layer of tomato sauce and sprinkling 2 cups of shredded mozzarella on top.
6. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the edges are golden brown.
7. Let the baked ziti cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
