# Chicken Fried Rice Recipe

If you're looking for an easy and flavorful dinner recipe, look no further than this chicken fried rice! Using just a few simple ingredients and one skillet, you can have a hearty and delicious meal in no time.

## Ingredients
### For the rice:
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| White rice (long-grain) | 2 cups |
| Water | 3 cups |
| Salt | 1/2 tsp |

### For the chicken:
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Boneless, skinless chicken breasts | 2 |
| Soy sauce | 1 tbsp |
| Cornstarch | 1 tbsp |
| Salt | 1/2 tsp |
| Black pepper | 1/4 tsp |

### For the vegetables:
| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Carrots, diced | 1 cup |
| Frozen peas | 1 cup |
| Onion, diced | 1/2 cup |
| Garlic, minced | 2 cloves |
| Vegetable oil | 2 tbsp |

## Instructions
1. Rinse the rice under running water until the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, combine the rice, water, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender.
2. While the rice is cooking, dice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, cornstarch, salt, and black pepper. Add the chicken to the bowl and toss to coat.
3. In a large skillet or wok, heat the vegetable oil over high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until lightly browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the diced onion and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic, carrots, and frozen peas, and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
5. Return the chicken to the skillet and add the cooked rice. Stir everything together until well combined and heated through, about 2-3 minutes.
6. Serve immediately and enjoy!

This recipe makes approximately 4 servings, so adjust the ingredient quantities accordingly depending on how many people you're feeding. You can also add additional seasonings like ginger, sesame oil, or hot sauce to customize the flavor even further.
