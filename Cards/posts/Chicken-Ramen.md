| Soy sauce | 3 tablespoons |
| Mirin | 3 tablespoons |
| Sake | 3 tablespoons |
| Brown sugar | 1 tablespoon |
| Garlic (minced) | 2 cloves |
| Ginger (minced) | 2 tablespoons |

### For the Ramen

| Ingredients | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Chuka soba ramen noodles | 4 servings |
| Chicken breast (sliced) | 2 |
| Salt | 1/2 teaspoon |
| Black pepper | 1/4 teaspoon |
| Garlic powder | 1/4 teaspoon |
| Paprika | 1/4 teaspoon |
| Vegetable oil | 1 tablespoon |
| Eggs (soft-boiled) | 4 |
| Spinach (blanched) | 4 handfuls |
| Shiitake mushrooms (sliced) | 1 cup |
| Nori (optional) | 4 sheets |

## Instructions

1. In a large pot, combine the chicken broth, soy sauce, mirin, sake, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and scallions. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and let the broth simmer for 15-20 minutes.
2. While the broth is simmering, season the sliced chicken breasts with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet, add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes until softened. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and rinse under cold water.
5. To assemble the ramen bowls, divide the cooked noodles among four large bowls. Ladle the hot broth into each bowl, making sure to include the minced garlic and ginger. Arrange the chicken slices, soft-boiled eggs, spinach, and shiitake mushrooms on top of the noodles. Garnish each bowl with a sheet of nori if desired.
6. Serve hot and enjoy!

## Notes

- If you can't find chuka soba ramen noodles, you can use any type of ramen noodles available at your local grocery store.
- Soft-boiled eggs can be prepared by boiling them for 6-7 minutes and then plunging them into an ice bath to stop the cooking process.
