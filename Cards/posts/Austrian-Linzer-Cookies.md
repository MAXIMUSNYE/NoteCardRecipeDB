# Austrian Linzer Cookies Recipe

This classic Austrian dessert is a buttery and nutty treat perfect for the holidays. The dough is filled with raspberry jam, adding a burst of flavor in each bite.

## Ingredients
### Pastry
| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ------ | --------- |
| 2 cups | All-purpose flour |
| 1 cup | Ground almonds |
| 1/2 tsp | Ground cinnamon |
| 1/4 tsp | Ground cloves |
| 1 cup | Unsalted butter, room temperature |
| 2/3 cup | Granulated sugar |
| 2 | Egg yolks |
| 1 tsp | Vanilla extract |

### Filling
| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ------ | --------- |
| 1 cup | Raspberry jam |

### Topping
| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ------ | --------- |
| 1/2 cup | Powdered sugar |

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, ground almonds, cinnamon, and cloves. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, beat together butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add in egg yolks and vanilla extract, continue beating until well combined.
4. Add in flour mixture and stir until just combined. The dough will be crumbly but should hold together when pinched between your fingers.
5. Divide the dough in half and roll each half out on a lightly floured surface to a little less than 1/4 inch thickness. Using a cookie cutter, cut out the dough into desired shapes.
6. Place the cookies on the baking sheets and use a smaller cookie cutter to cut out the centers of half of the cookies.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden.
8. Allow the cookies to cool completely on a wire rack before assembly.
9. Once cooled, spread a thin layer of raspberry jam on the solid cookies and top with the cookies with the center cut out.
10. Lastly, dust powdered sugar on the cookies with the center cut out to complete the look of the Austrian Linzer Cookies.
11. Serve and enjoy!
