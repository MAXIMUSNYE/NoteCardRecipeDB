4. Add the egg yolks and lemon zest and continue to beat until well combined.
5. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and stir until a dough is formed.
6. Divide the dough into two portions, wrap in cling film, and chill for 30 minutes.
7. Roll out one portion of the dough between two sheets of parchment paper to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.
8. Use a 2-inch cookie cutter to cut out circles, and place them on the prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart.
9. Repeat the process with the second portion of the dough but use a smaller cookie cutter to cut out the centers of the cookies.
10. Bake both cookie sheets in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes or until just golden.
11. Allow the cookies to cool slightly before spreading the raspberry jam onto the whole cookies.
12. Dust the cut-out cookies with powdered sugar.
13. Sandwich the cookies together and serve!
