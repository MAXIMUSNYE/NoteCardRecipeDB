## Ingredients

### For the Salmon:

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 lb     | Salmon fillet, skin-on |
| 1/4 cup  | Sea salt |
| 1/4 cup  | Sugar |
| 1/4 cup  | Fresh dill, chopped |
| 2 tbsp   | Juniper berries, crushed |

| -------- | ---------- |
| 1         | Lemon, thinly sliced |

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, sugar, dill, juniper berries, and black peppercorns.
2. Lay out a large sheet of plastic wrap on a flat surface.
3. Place the salmon fillet, skin-side down, on the plastic wrap.
4. Rub the salt mixture onto the flesh of the salmon, covering it completely.
5. Wrap the salmon tightly in the plastic wrap, making sure to seal it completely.
6. Place the wrapped salmon in a baking dish, and place another dish on top of it.
7. Weigh down the top dish with cans or other heavy objects, to press the salmon down and ensure even cure.
8. Refrigerate the salmon for 24-48 hours, flipping it occasionally to redistribute the cure.
9. After 24-48 hours, remove the salmon from the plastic wrap and rinse it under cold water.
10. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and place it on a clean cutting board, skin-side down.
11. Using a sharp knife, thinly slice the salmon at an angle, against the grain, to desired thickness.
12. Serve the gravlax on a platter, garnished with lemon slices, capers, and fresh dill sprigs.

Enjoy your homemade gravlax, and impress your friends and family with your cooking skills!
