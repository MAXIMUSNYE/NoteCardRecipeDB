## Steps

1. In a medium bowl, combine ground beef, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, cornstarch, and black pepper. Mix well to combine.

2. In a separate bowl, mix together flour and salt. Slowly add warm water and knead until you have a smooth dough. Cover and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.

3. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into a long rope and cut it into small pieces. Roll out each piece into a thin circle.

4. Place about one tablespoon of beef filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough over the filling, pinching the edges together to seal tightly.

5. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the potstickers in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes until browned.

6. Add the water to the skillet and cover with a lid. Steam the potstickers for 5-7 minutes or until cooked through.

7. Serve hot and enjoy!
