2. Heat a pan over high heat and add vegetable oil.

3. Once the pan is hot, carefully take the beef steak out of the zip-lock bag, shaking off any excess marinade, and place it in the pan. Sear for 2-3 minutes on each side or until you reach the desired doneness.

4. Remove the beef steak from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing it thinly.

5. Cut the baguette in half, horizontally, and spread mayo and Maggi sauce on both inner sides.

6. Arrange the sliced beef steak, cucumber slices, shredded carrots, cilantro leaves, and jalapeno on the bottom half of the baguette. Sprinkle salt and black pepper on top.

7. Top with the other half of the baguette and press down gently.

8. Slice the baguette into pieces and serve.
