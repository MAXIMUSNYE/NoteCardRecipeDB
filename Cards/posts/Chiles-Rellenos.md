## Ingredients

### For the Chiles

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 6 | Anaheim chiles |
| 2 cups | Monterey jack cheese, shredded |
| 1/2 cup | All-purpose flour |
| 1/2 tsp | Salt |
| 3 | Eggs separated |
| 1/2 cup | Vegetable oil |

### For the Sauce

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 4 medium | Tomatoes |
| 1/2 medium | Onion |
| 1 clove | Garlic |
| 2 tbsp | Vegetable oil |
| 1 cup | Chicken broth |
| 1/2 tsp | Salt |
| 1/2 tsp | Dried oregano |
| 1/4 tsp | Ground cumin |
| 2 tbsp | Flour |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
2. Roast the chiles on a baking sheet in the oven until the skins are blistered. Turn to cook evenly.
3. Remove the chiles from the oven and place in a paper bag to steam for 10 minutes.
4. Remove the chiles from the bag and peel off the skins. Leave the stems intact and make a small incision on the side of each pepper to remove the seeds.
5. Stuff the chiles with shredded cheese and set aside.
6. In a bowl, combine flour and salt. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. In another bowl, beat the egg yolks.
7. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the egg yolks. Dip each pepper in the flour mixture, then coat with the egg mixture.
8. Heat vegetable oil in a pan on medium heat. Fry each pepper until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels and keep warm.
9. For the sauce, blend the tomatoes, onion, and garlic in a blender until smooth.
10. Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan on medium heat. Add the tomato mixture and cook for 5 minutes.
11. Stir in chicken broth, salt, oregano, and cumin. Mix flour with 1/4 cup cold water until smooth and stir into the tomato mixture.
12. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and the flavors combine.
13. Serve Chiles Rellenos with the tomato sauce on top. Enjoy!
