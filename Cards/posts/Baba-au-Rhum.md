| 1/4 cup | sugar |
| 1/2 teaspoon | salt |
| 1 tablespoon | active dry yeast |

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water.

4. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms.

5. Add the eggs one at a time and mix until well combined.

6. Add the softened butter and mix until the dough becomes smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutes.

7. Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes.

8. Grease a 9-inch (23-cm) cake pan and add the dough to it. Smooth the surface with a spatula.

9. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown.

10. While the cake is baking, make the rum syrup. Add the water and sugar to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add the rum.

11. When the cake is done, remove it from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool.

12. Once the cake has cooled, poke several holes in it with a toothpick and pour the rum syrup over it, allowing it to soak in.

13. Let the cake sit for at least an hour before serving.

14. When you're ready to serve, top the cake with whipped cream and fresh fruit. 

Enjoy your delicious Baba au Rhum!
