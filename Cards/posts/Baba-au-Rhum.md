## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Mix well.

2. Add in the eggs and stir until the dough comes together.

3. Cut the butter into small pieces and mix it into the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.

4. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 10 minutes until it is glossy and elastic.

5. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a clean towel. Allow the dough to rise in a warm place for 1 hour.

6. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

7. Grease a brioche pan or a muffin tin.

8. Divide the dough into 8-10 even pieces and shape them into small balls. Place the dough balls into the greased pan.

9. Cover the pan with a clean towel and allow the dough to rise again in a warm place for 30 minutes.

10. Bake the brioche for 20-25 minutes, or until it is golden brown.

11. While the brioche is baking, make the rum syrup. In a medium saucepan, bring the water and sugar to a boil and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the syrup from the heat and stir in the rum.

12. Once the brioche is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool.

13. Using a skewer or toothpick, poke holes all over the brioche.

14. Slowly pour the rum syrup over the entire brioche, allowing it to soak in.

15. Place the brioche in the refrigerator and allow it to chill for at least an hour.

16. Serve the baba au rhum with sweetened whipped cream and sliced almonds on top.

Enjoy this decadent and boozy dessert!
