# Cherry Clafoutis Recipe

This easy and delicious Cherry Clafoutis is a classic French dessert that is perfect for showcasing fresh cherries. With a light and airy custard base, this dessert is both comforting and elegant.

## Ingredients

### For the cherry filling:

| Amount | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 2 cups | Fresh cherries, pitted |
| 1 tbsp | Butter |
| 3 tbsp | Granulated sugar |

### For the batter:

| Amount | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | Large eggs |
| 1/2 cup | Granulated Sugar |
| 1/2 cup | All-purpose flour |
| 1 cup | Whole milk |
| 1/2 tsp | Vanilla extract |
| Pinch | Salt |

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Butter a 9-inch (23 cm) baking dish and set aside.

2. In a medium skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the cherries and sugar and stir to combine. Cook until the cherries are slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until pale and frothy. Add the flour, milk, vanilla extract, and salt, and whisk until smooth.

4. Pour the cherry mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish, then pour the batter over the top.

5. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center is set.

6. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with powdered sugar and/or fresh cherries, if desired. Enjoy!
