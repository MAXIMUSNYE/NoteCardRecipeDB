# Battenberg Cake Recipe

## Ingredients

### Cake

|Ingredients | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Butter | 250g |
| Sugar | 250g |
| Eggs | 4 |
| Self-raising flour | 250g |
| Almond extract | 1 tsp |
| Red food coloring | a few drops |

### Filling

| Ingredients | Quantity |
|---|---|
| Apricot jam | 4 tbsp |
| Marzipan | 500g |

## Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 180Â°C. Grease and line a 20cm square cake tin with baking paper.
2. Begin by making the cake. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, making sure each one is fully incorporated. Add in the almond extract and mix well.
4. Carefully fold in the self-raising flour until the batter is smooth and well combined.
5. Divide the cake mixture equally between two bowls. In one bowl, add a few drops of red food coloring and mix well until you achieve a deep pink color.
6. Pour each mixture into its own half of the prepared cake tin. Smooth the surface of each half with a spatula.
7. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cake is cooked through and golden brown.
8. Remove the cakes from the tin and leave to cool on a wire rack.
9. Once the cakes have cooled, carefully trim off the edges to make two even rectangles.
10. Heat the apricot jam in a small saucepan over low heat until it becomes runny.
11. Roll out the marzipan on a clean surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to the same size as the two cake rectangles.
12. Brush one of the cake rectangles with a thin layer of the warmed apricot jam.
13. Place the other cake rectangle on top of the jam-covered one to make a sandwich.
14. Spread a thin layer of apricot jam all over the top and sides of the cake sandwich.
15. Carefully wrap the marzipan around the cake, pressing down on the edges to seal.
16. Trim any excess marzipan from the edges to give the Battenberg cake a neat finish.
17. Slice the cake crosswise to reveal the classic pink-and-white checkered pattern. Serve and enjoy!
