## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 170C degrees.
2. Grease and line an 18 cm square baking tin with parchment paper.
3. Cream the butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy.
4. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl, and then gradually add it into the butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.
5. Sift in the flour and fold gently.
6. Fold in the almond extract.
7. Divide the batter into half, and add pink food coloring to half of it.
8. Pour the plain batter into one half of the prepared tin and the pink batter into the other half.
9. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
10. Let it cool for 5 minutes, remove from the tin, and let it cool completely.
11. Trim the edges of both cakes and cut each cake in half lengthways.
12. Heat up the apricot jam in a small saucepan over low heat until it's runny, then set it aside to cool.
13. Roll the marzipan to a rectangular shape big enough to wrap the cake.
14. Lay the pink and white cake strips alternately to create a checkerboard pattern, using the apricot jam as a glue between them.
15. Brush the marzipan with apricot jam and place the checked sponge along one edge of the marzipan.
16. Brush more apricot jam on the other three sides and top of the sponge.
17. Fold the marzipan tightly around the sponge, pressing the edges together to seal it.
18. Trim off any excess marzipan.
19. In a bowl, mix together icing sugar and water to your desired consistency.
20. Transfer to a piping bag and decorate the cake with horizontal and vertical lines.
21. Serve and enjoy!
