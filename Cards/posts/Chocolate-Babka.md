## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, combine warm milk and yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy. 
2. To the bowl, add sugar, eggs, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and salt. 
4. Add the flour mixture to wet ingredients, a cup at a time, mixing until just combined. 
5. Add cubed butter to the mixture and knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
6. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for about 2 hours until doubled in size.
7. To make the filling, melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water. Stir until smooth.
8. Whisk together granulated sugar, brown sugar, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salt in a separate bowl.
9. Once chocolate mixture cools, add the sugar mixture and stir to combine.
10. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle. Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a small margin around the edges.
11. Roll the dough up tightly from the long end and seal the edge.
12. Cut the dough in half lengthwise. Turn the cut side up and twist the two pieces together. Place the twisted dough in a greased loaf pan.
13. In a small bowl, combine flour, sugar, melted butter, and salt to make the streusel topping.
14. Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over the dough. 
15. Cover the pan with a towel and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour until doubled in size.
16. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and bake the babka for about 50 minutes until golden brown and cooked through.
17. Allow the babka to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
