# Escargots de Bourgogne Recipe

## Ingredients:

| Component              | Ingredient                                    | Quantity |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|
| Escargots | Canned Escargots  | 24 |
| Garlic Butter | Unsalted Butter, softened | 1/2 cup |
| | Garlic, minced | 4 cloves |
| | Parsley, finely chopped | 2 tbsp |
| | Salt | 1/2 tsp |
| | Black Pepper | 1/4 tsp |
| Fillings (optional) | Bacon, cooked and crumbled | 1/4 cup |
| | Mushroom, finely chopped | 1/4 cup |
| | Shallots, finely chopped | 1/4 cup |

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. Clean the escargots by rinsing them under cool running water and drain them well.
3. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and add the minced garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant.
4. Remove the butter from the heat and stir in the parsley, salt, and black pepper.
5. If using fillings, mix the bacon, mushroom, and shallots together in a small bowl.
6. Place a small amount of filling (if using) into each escargot shell, then add an escargot to each shell.
7. Top each escargot with the garlic butter mixture, about 1/2 tsp for each.
8. Arrange the filled escargot shells on a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the butter is bubbling and the escargots are heated through.
9. Serve immediately with warm French bread to soak up the delicious garlic butter sauce.
