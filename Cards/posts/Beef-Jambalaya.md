## Instructions:

1. In a small bowl, mix together the paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Season the beef with the spice mixture and toss to coat evenly.

4. Add the diced onion, bell pepper, celery, and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are softened.

5. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken broth, bay leaves, Cajun seasoning, and thyme to the skillet. Bring the mixture to a boil.

6. Add the long grain white rice to the skillet and stir to combine. Bring the mixture back to a boil. 

7. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer for 20 minutes until the rice is fully cooked.

8. Once the rice is cooked, add the beef and andouille sausage back to the skillet. Continue to simmer until the beef is heated through.

9. Remove the bay leaves and serve hot.
