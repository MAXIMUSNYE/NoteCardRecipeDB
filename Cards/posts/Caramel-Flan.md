# Caramel Flan Recipe

## Ingredients:

### For the caramel:

| Ingredients    | Quantity  |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Granulated sugar | 1 cup    |
| Water          | 1/4 cup  |

### For the flan:

| Ingredients       | Quantity   |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Sweetened condensed milk | 14 oz can |
| Evaporated milk  | 12 oz can |
| Eggs (large)    | 4          |
| Vanilla extract | 1 teaspoon |

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F.
2. In a heavy saucepan, melt sugar over low heat, stirring constantly until it's melted and golden brown. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Immediately pour the melted caramel into a 9-inch round baking dish, tilting to coat the bottom and sides of the dish. Set aside to cool.
4. In a blender, combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth.
5. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.
6. Fill a larger baking dish with about 1 inch of hot water. Place the baking dish with the flan mixture into the larger baking dish. The water should reach about halfway up the sides of the baking dish.
7. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
8. Remove from the oven and let the flan cool to room temperature on a wire rack.
9. Once cooled, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.
10. When ready to serve, run a knife around the edge of the baking dish to loosen the flan. Invert onto a serving platter to release the flan from the dish and reveal the caramel sauce.
11. Serve chilled and enjoy your delicious homemade caramel flan.
