## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

4. Gradually add the ice water, using a fork to mix until a dough forms.

6. Wrap the discs in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

### For the Filling:

7. Season the beef cubes with salt and black pepper.

8. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

9. Add the beef cubes to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides.

10. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic to the skillet and cook until softened.

11. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to combine.

### Assembling the Pie:

20. Bake the pie for 45-50 minutes until the crust is golden brown.

21. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
