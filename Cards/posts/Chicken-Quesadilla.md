| Ingredient      | Amount      |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Tomatoes        | 2 medium, chopped |
| Onion           | 1 small, chopped |

| Lime juice      | 1 tablespoon |

## Steps

1. To make the marinade, whisk together lime juice, cumin powder, chili powder, paprika, salt, and garlic powder in a small bowl. Gradually whisk in olive oil until well combined. Place chicken breasts in a shallow dish and pour marinade over chicken, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

2. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove chicken from marinade and discard marinade. Grill chicken until cooked through, about 6-8 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for 5 minutes before shredding.

3. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Brush one side of each tortilla with olive oil and place them on a baking sheet, oiled side down.

4. In a large bowl, combine shredded chicken, shredded cheese, and sliced green onions. Mix until well combined.

5. Spoon the chicken mixture onto half of each tortilla, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edge.

6. Fold the tortillas in half, pressing down lightly to seal.

7. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and tortillas are golden brown.

8. While quesadillas are baking, make the salsa by mixing chopped tomatoes, onion, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, lime juice, and salt in a medium bowl.

9. Once quesadillas are done, remove from the oven and let them cool for a minute before cutting them into wedges.

10. Serve quesadillas hot with the fresh salsa on top or on the side. Enjoy!
