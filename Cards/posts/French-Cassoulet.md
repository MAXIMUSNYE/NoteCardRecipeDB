## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F.
2. Rinse the dried beans under cold water and let it soak for 8-10 hours or overnight in a large bowl.
3. In a large Dutch oven or casserole pot, cook the pork shoulder in a tablespoon of oil until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Transfer the pork shoulder to a platter.
4. In the same pot, add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Cook until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes.
5. Stir in the tomato paste until the vegetables are coated. Add the white wine and let it reduce by half.
6. Add the thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and pork sausage. Return the pork shoulder to the pot and add enough stock to cover. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, on low heat for 1 hour.
7. Remove the skin and bones from the duck confit legs. Add them to the pot with the beans, and season with salt and pepper.
8. Bring to a simmer, cover, and place in the preheated oven for 2-3 hours or until the beans are tender and the meat falls off the bone.
9. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes.
10. Serve hot with slices of bread or baguette. Enjoy!

**Note:** Cassoulet can be prepared a day in advance and reheated in a preheated oven.
