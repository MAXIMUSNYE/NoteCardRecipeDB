## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

7. Bake the patties for about 20-25 minutes, until they are cooked through and golden brown.

### To make the Red Pepper Sauce
1. Roast the red bell peppers by placing them directly over a gas burner on high heat, or by broiling them in the oven until the skins are charred.
2. Place the peppers in a bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap for about 10 minutes to loosen the skins.
3. Remove skins from the peppers and cut them into small pieces.
4. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat, then add onion and garlic. Cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
5. Add the chopped peppers, paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper to the skillet.
6. Stir and cook for a few minutes until the sauce is heated through.
7. Puree the sauce in a blender or food processor.
8. Serve the warm Chickpea Lamb Cakes with the Red Pepper Sauce. Enjoy!
