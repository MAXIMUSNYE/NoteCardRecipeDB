# Cheese Soufflé Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the soufflé base:

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 2 tbsp | Unsalted butter |
| 2 tbsp | All-purpose flour |
| 1 cup | Milk |
| 4 | Large egg yolks |
| 1/2 tsp | Salt |
| 1/2 tsp | Black pepper |
| 1/4 tsp | Cayenne pepper |

### For the soufflé topping:

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 6 | Large egg whites |
| 1/4 tsp | Cream of tartar |
| 1/2 cup | Grated cheese (cheddar or gruyere) |

## Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F.

2. Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Add flour and whisk for 1-2 minutes to form a thick paste. Remove from heat.

3. Slowly add milk to the paste while whisking continuously to create a smooth sauce. Return the saucepan to the heat and whisk until the sauce has thickened, about 2-3 minutes.

4. Remove the saucepan from heat and add in egg yolks, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir all the ingredients together.

5. In a separate bowl, whisk egg whites and cream of tartar until they form stiff peaks.

6. Fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the soufflé mixture, taking care not to deflate the egg whites too much.

7. Fold in the rest of the egg whites and grated cheese, reserving a small amount of cheese for the top.

8. Pour the mixture into a greased soufflé dish and sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.

9. Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes or until the soufflé is golden brown and has risen about 2 inches above the top of the dish.

10. Serve immediately and enjoy! The soufflé will deflate after a few minutes and lose its fluffy texture, so it's best to serve it right out of the oven.
