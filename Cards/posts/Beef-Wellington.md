# Beef Wellington Recipe

## Ingredients

### Beef and Mushroom Duxelles

| Ingredients | Quantity |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Beef Tenderloin | 1 (2-3 pounds) |
| Salt | 1 teaspoon |
| Black pepper | 1 teaspoon |
| Olive oil | 1 tablespoon |
| Butter | 2 tablespoons |
| Garlic cloves, minced | 3 cloves |
| White button mushrooms, minced | 8 ounces |

### Puff Pastry

| Ingredients | Quantity |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Puff pastry | 1 sheet |
| All-purpose flour | 1 tablespoon |
| Egg | 1 |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).

2. Season the beef tenderloin with salt and black pepper. Heat the olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat then sear the beef for 2 minutes on each side until browned. Remove from heat and let cool.

3. In the same skillet over medium heat, add the garlic and mushrooms. Cook for 8-10 minutes until the mushrooms release their liquid. Remove from heat and let cool.

4. Arrange a sheet of plastic wrap on a work surface and place the mushroom mixture on it. Spread the mixture evenly and place the cooled beef tenderloin on top. Use the plastic wrap to wrap the beef tenderloin with the mushroom mixture tightly. Chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.

5. Dust a flat surface with all-purpose flour and roll out the puff pastry sheet to form a rectangle. Place the beef tenderloin in the center of the pastry and wrap it tightly.

6. Beat the egg and brush onto the pastry to make it golden brown.

7. Place the wrapped beef tenderloin on a baking sheet, seam-side down. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the pastry is puffed and golden brown.

8. Remove from oven, let rest for 10 minutes then slice and serve. Enjoy your Beef Wellington!
