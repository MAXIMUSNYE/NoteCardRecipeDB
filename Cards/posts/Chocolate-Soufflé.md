## Ingredients

### For the Chocolate Base

| Quantity | Ingredient       |
| -------- | -----------------|
| 1/2 cup  | Semi-sweet chocolate chips |
| 2 tbsp   | Unsalted butter  |
| 2 tbsp   | Granulated sugar |
| 1 tsp    | Vanilla extract  |
| 2        | Large egg yolks  |

### For the Meringue

| Quantity | Ingredient       |
| -------- | -----------------|
| 3        | Large egg whites |
| 1/4 tsp  | Cream of tartar  |
| 1/4 cup  | Granulated sugar |

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F / 190°C and grease four 6-ounce ramekins with butter.
2. In a double boiler, melt the chocolate chips and unsalted butter until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the granulated sugar and vanilla extract.
3. Beat the egg yolks in a separate bowl until thick and pale yellow. Fold in the chocolate mixture until well combined.
4. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-high speed until soft peaks form.
5. Gradually add in the granulated sugar while continuing to beat on high speed until stiff peaks form.
6. Fold the meringue mixture into the chocolate mixture until well combined.
7. Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared ramekins, filling them up to 3/4 full.
8. Smooth the top of each ramekin with a spatula and run your thumb around the edge of each ramekin to create a shallow trough.
9. Place the ramekins on a baking sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the soufflés have risen and are no longer jiggly.
10. Serve immediately with a dollop of whipped cream and fresh berries.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate soufflé!
