| Olive oil | 2 tbsp |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Pepper | 1/2 tsp |
| Ground cumin | 1 tsp |
| Paprika | 1 tsp |

### For the Tagine
| Ingredient | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Onion, diced | 1 large |

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F.
2. In a large pot, heat the olive oil on medium-high heat.
3. Add the beef stew meat, salt, pepper, cumin, and paprika. Sauté until browned on all sides, for about 5 minutes.
4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the beef and set it aside.
5. In the same pot, add the onion, garlic, carrots, and sweet potatoes. Sauté until the onion is translucent and the vegetables are slightly browned, around 5 minutes.
6. Add the canned tomatoes, beef stock, cinnamon, ginger, coriander, honey, and salt to the pot. Stir everything together and bring to a boil.
7. Return the beef to the pot and give it a good stir.
8. Cover the pot with a lid and transfer to the preheated oven.
9. Cook for around 2 hours, checking and stirring every 30 minutes. If the Tagine becomes too hot, reduce the heat accordingly.
10. Once the beef and vegetables are tender, remove the pot from the oven and top with fresh cilantro.
11. Serve hot with some bread or couscous on the side.
