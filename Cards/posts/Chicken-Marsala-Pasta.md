## Ingredients

### Chicken

| Amount | Ingredient |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1 pound | boneless, skinless chicken breasts |
| 1/4 cup | all-purpose flour |
| 1/2 teaspoon | salt |
| 1/4 teaspoon | black pepper |
| 2 tablespoons | olive oil |

### Pasta

| Amount | Ingredient |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 8 ounces | spaghetti |
| 1 teaspoon | salt |
| 1 tablespoon | olive oil |

### Marsala Sauce

| Amount | Ingredient |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 2 tablespoons | butter |
| 1 tablespoon | olive oil |
| 8 ounces | baby bella mushrooms, sliced |
| 1/2 cup | Marsala wine |

| 1/2 cup | heavy cream |

## Instructions

1. In a shallow dish, combine flour, salt, and pepper. Dredge chicken breasts in flour mixture, shaking off excess.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes on both sides until golden brown and cooked through. Remove chicken from skillet and set aside.

3. While chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente, following the package instructions. Drain pasta and toss with olive oil to prevent sticking.

4. In the same skillet used to cook chicken, melt butter and heat olive oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms and saut√© until tender, about 5 minutes.

5. Add Marsala wine and chicken broth to skillet. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for about 10 minutes, or until sauce has thickened slightly.

6. Stir in heavy cream, salt, and pepper. Return chicken to skillet and let cook for another 5 minutes, or until chicken is heated through.

7. Serve chicken and sauce over a bed of cooked spaghetti. Enjoy!
