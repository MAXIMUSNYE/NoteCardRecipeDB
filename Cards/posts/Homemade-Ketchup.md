| White vinegar | 1/4 cup |
| Brown sugar | 2 tbsp |

## Steps

1. In a small mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients for the spice blend and set aside.

3. Add the spice blend to the saucepan and stir to fully incorporate.

4. Place the saucepan on medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the ketchup has thickened to your desired consistency.

5. Remove from heat and let the ketchup cool to room temperature.

6. Transfer the ketchup to a clean, airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to one month.
