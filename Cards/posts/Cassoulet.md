| 2 | garlic cloves, peeled |
| 1 | bouquet garni (thyme, parsley, and bay leaf) |

### For the meat

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 8 ounces | smoked bacon, cut into small pieces |
| 4 | garlic cloves, chopped |
| 1 | onion, chopped |
| 1 | carrot, chopped |
| 1 pound | boneless pork shoulder cut into 1-inch pieces |
| 4 | duck legs |
| 4 | Italian sausages |
| Salt | to taste |
| Pepper | to taste |

### For the bread crumbs

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 1/2 cups | fresh bread crumbs |
| 1/4 cup | goose fat or olive oil |
| 1/4 cup | chopped parsley |

## Instructions

1. Drain the soaked beans, then add them to a large pot with the onion, garlic, and bouquet garni. Cover with water by 1-2 inches and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
2. Reduce the heat and simmer, half-covered, until the beans are tender, about 45-60 minutes. Season with salt, then remove and discard the onion, garlic, and bouquet garni. Drain the beans and reserve the cooking liquid.
3. Preheat the oven to 325°F.
4. In a large Dutch oven or casserole over medium heat, sauté the bacon until crisp and browned. Add the garlic, onion, and carrot and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
5. Add the pork and duck, season with salt and pepper, and cook until well-browned on all sides.
6. Add the reserved cooking liquid and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
7. In the meantime, grill or fry the sausages until cooked through.
8. Remove the lid from the Dutch oven and arrange the sausages on top. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and parsley and drizzle with goose fat or olive oil.
9. Bake in the oven for 1 1/2-2 hours, or until the meat is falling apart and the crust is golden brown and crispy.
10. Serve hot with crusty bread and a green salad.
