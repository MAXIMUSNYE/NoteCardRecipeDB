## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 375F.
2. Take your Chateaubriand steak out of the fridge and let it rest for 30 minutes so that it comes to room temperature.
3. Pat the steak dry with a paper towel. 
4. Season the steak with salt and black pepper on both sides.
5. Heat the olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Once the oil is hot, add the steak to the skillet and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side until a crust forms.
7. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook for 10-15 minutes until the steak reaches an internal temperature of 125F for medium-rare. 
8. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the steak to a cutting board.
9. Let the steak rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing.
10. While the steak is resting, make the sauce. Heat a separate saucepan over medium heat and add the chopped shallots. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the shallots soften.
11. Add the beef stock and red wine and increase the heat to high. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until the liquid has reduced by half.
12. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the unsalted butter until it melts and thickens the sauce.
13. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.
14. Slice the steak and serve with the sauce.


Enjoy your delicious Chateaubriand steak with a flavorful sauce!
