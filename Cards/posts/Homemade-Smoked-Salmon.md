## Ingredients

### For the Salmon

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh salmon filet | 1 pound |
| Kosher salt | 1/4 cup |
| Brown sugar | 1/4 cup |
| Ground black pepper | 1 tablespoon |
| Wood chips (such as cherry or hickory) | 2 cups |

### For the Dill Cream Cheese

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Cream cheese, softened | 8 ounces |
| Fresh dill, chopped | 2 tablespoons |
| Lemon juice | 1 tablespoon |

## Instructions

1. Pat the salmon filet dry with paper towels and place it on a large piece of plastic wrap.

2. In a small bowl, mix together the kosher salt, brown sugar, and black pepper. Rub the mixture all over the salmon filet, making sure it is evenly coated.

3. Wrap the salmon tightly in the plastic wrap and refrigerate it for at least 6 hours (or up to 24 hours) to cure.

4. Heat your smoker to 225°F. Soak the wood chips in water for at least 30 minutes.

5. Remove the salmon from the plastic wrap and rinse it under cold water to remove the cure mixture. Pat it dry with paper towels.

6. Place the salmon on the smoking grate and add the soaked wood chips to the smoker box or directly to the coals. Close the lid and smoke the salmon for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it is cooked through and has reached an internal temperature of 145°F.

7. In a small bowl, combine the softened cream cheese, chopped dill, and lemon juice. Mix well.

8. Once the salmon has finished smoking, remove it from the smoker and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing it into thin pieces.

9. Serve the smoked salmon with the dill cream cheese, crackers, or sliced baguette.

Enjoy your delicious homemade smoked salmon!
