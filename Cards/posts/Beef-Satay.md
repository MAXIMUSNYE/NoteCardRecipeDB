## Steps:

1. In a bowl, whisk together all the ingredients for the marinade.
2. Add the beef strips to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours.
3. In the meantime, soak the wooden skewers in water for at least 20 minutes to prevent them from burning during grilling.
4. Preheat grill to medium-high heat.
5. Thread beef strips onto skewers.
6. Grill the beef skewers for about 3-4 minutes per side or until cooked to your liking.
7. While the beef skewers are cooking, prepare the peanut sauce. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine all the peanut sauce ingredients and whisk until smooth. Cook for 5-7 minutes or until heated through.
8. Serve the hot beef skewers with the peanut sauce for dipping. Enjoy!
