## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
2. Peel and cube sweet potatoes into small chunks. Place them in a pot of boiling water and cook for about 20 minutes, or until they are soft and can be easily pierced with a fork. Drain the water and mash the sweet potatoes in a mixing bowl.
3. Add the brown sugar, butter, milk, cinnamon powder, and salt to the mashed sweet potatoes. Mix everything together well and set the mixture aside.
4. Put the dried apricots, orange juice, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Lower the heat and let it simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the apricots are softened. Remove the saucepan from heat and use a blender or immersion blender to blend the apricot mixture into a puree.
5. Pour the apricot mixture on top of the sweet potato mixture in a baking dish.
6. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, and chopped pecans. Cut in the butter until the mixture forms coarse crumbs.
7. Sprinkle the topping on top of the apricot mixture in the baking dish.
8. Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes, or until the topping is crispy and golden brown.
9. Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool a bit before serving.
