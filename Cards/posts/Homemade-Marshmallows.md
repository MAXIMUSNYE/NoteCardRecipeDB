## Ingredients

### For the Marshmallow Base:
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 3 tbsp | unflavored gelatin |
| 1 cup | cold water |
| 2 cups | granulated sugar |
| 1/2 cup | corn syrup |
| 1/4 tsp | salt |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract |
| Powdered sugar |

### For Coating the Marshmallows:
| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Powdered sugar |
| Cornstarch |

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl, mix the gelatin with 1/2 cup of cold water and let it sit for 10 minutes to soften.

2. In a large saucepan, combine the sugar, corn syrup, salt, and the remaining 1/2 cup of water. Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves.

3. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover the pot and let the mixture cook for 2-3 minutes.

4. Remove the lid and insert a candy thermometer into the pot. Decrease the heat to medium-high and let the mixture continue to cook until it reaches 240Â°F.

5. Remove the pot from the heat and carefully pour the hot sugar mixture into a large mixing bowl.

6. Add the softened gelatin mixture and beat on high speed with an electric mixer for 8-10 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and fluffy.

7. Add the vanilla extract and beat it for a few more seconds until it is evenly incorporated.

8. Cover a 9x13 inch baking dish with parchment paper and generously dust it with a mixture of powdered sugar and cornstarch.

9. Pour the marshmallow mixture into the prepared baking dish and use a spatula to smooth out the surface as much as possible.

10. Dust the top of the marshmallow mixture with more of the powdered sugar and cornstarch mixture.

11. Let the marshmallows sit uncovered at room temperature for at least 4 hours, or overnight, until they are firm.

12. When ready to cut the marshmallows, dust a cutting board with more of the powdered sugar and cornstarch mixture.

13. Use a sharp knife or cookie cutter coated in the powder mixture to cut the marshmallows into desired shapes and sizes.

14. Toss the cut marshmallows in the remaining powdered sugar and cornstarch mixture, making sure they are coated on all sides.

15. Store the marshmallows in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. Serve and enjoy!
