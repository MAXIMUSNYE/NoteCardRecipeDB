# Chestnut and Chocolate Roulade Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Roulade

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | Eggs |
| 1/2 cup | Granulated sugar |
| 1/4 cup | All-purpose flour |
| 1/4 cup | Unsweetened cocoa powder |
| 1 tsp | Baking powder |
| 1/4 tsp | Salt |

### For the Filling

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 1 cup | Canned chestnut puree |
| 1/2 cup | Confectioners’ sugar |
| 1/2 cup | Heavy cream |

### For the Ganache

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| --- | --- |
| 6 oz | Semisweet chocolate chips |
| 1/2 cup | Heavy cream |

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan, line it with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper and dust it with flour.
2. In a large bowl, beat the eggs until thick and lemon colored, gradually adding the granulated sugar. 
3. In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt; then fold the dry ingredients into the egg mixture. 
4. Pour the batter into the jelly roll pan and bake for 12-15 minutes or until the top springs back when touched.
5. Dust a clean kitchen towel with confectioners’ sugar and turn the cake out onto the towel. Roll up the cake in the towel and let cool completely.
6. In a medium bowl, beat the chestnut puree until light and fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners’ sugar and the heavy cream, beating until smooth and well combined.
7. Unroll the cooled cake and spread the chestnut filling evenly over the top. Reroll the cake and place it seam side down on a serving platter. 
8. To make the ganache, place the chocolate chips in a small bowl. In a small saucepan heat the cream over medium heat until it just begins to boil. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk until smooth. 
9. Pour the ganache over the top of the roulade, using a spatula to spread the ganache so that it coats the sides evenly.
10. Chill the roulade for 2-3 hours or until the ganache is set. Cut into slices to serve.
