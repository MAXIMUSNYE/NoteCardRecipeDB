## Preparation

1. Clean the duck breasts of any extra fat and silver skin. 
2. In a bowl, mix together the salt, sugar, black pepper, juniper berries, thyme, bay leaves, and garlic. 
3. Take your duck breasts and place them into a deep dish. 
4. Massage the salt mixture into the duck breasts, making sure it is evenly coated. 
5. Cover the dish with a plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours.
6. After curing is complete, rinse the duck breasts under cold running water, making sure to remove any remaining salt mixture. 
7. Pat them dry with a paper towel and wrap tightly in cheesecloth. 
8. Tie a string around the cheesecloth to ensure the shape of the prosciutto is maintained. 
9. Hang the duck prosciutto in a cool, dark place with good airflow. This can be a pantry or a basement. 
10. Allow the prosciutto to cure for 2-3 weeks or until the internal temperature is 55°F (13°C). 
11. Once cured, remove the cheesecloth and slice thinly.
12. Slice the fresh figs and serve them with the sliced prosciutto on a plate.
13. Drizzle the honey on top of the figs and prosciutto. 
14. Sprinkle fresh thyme over the plate and drizzle balsamic vinegar as desired. 
15. Serve the cured duck prosciutto with some bread or crackers.
