# Chicken Pho Soup Recipe

### Ingredients:

#### For the Broth
| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Chicken Bones | 2 lbs |
| Onion, quartered | 1 medium |
| Ginger, sliced | 1 inch piece |
| Star Anise | 2 |
| Cinnamon Stick | 1 |
| Cloves | 3 |
| Cardamom Pods | 3 |
| Fish Sauce | 2 tbsp |
| Salt | To Taste |

#### For the Soup 
| Ingredient | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Rice Noodles | 8 oz |
| Chicken Breast, sliced | 1 lb |
| Bean Sprouts | 2 cups |
| Cilantro Leaves | 1/4 cup |
| Mint Leaves | 1/4 cup |
| Limes | 2 |
| Sriracha Sauce | To Taste |

### Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Place chicken bones in a baking sheet, and roast for about 20 minutes until golden brown.

2. In a large stockpot, add roasted chicken bones, onion, ginger, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, fish sauce, and enough water to cover all the ingredients. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for at least 2 hours.

3. Strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer and discard any solids. Add salt to taste.

4. While the broth is simmering, soak the rice noodles in hot water until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.

5. In a separate pot of boiling water, cook the chicken breast for 10-12 minutes until no longer pink. Remove the chicken from the pot and slice into thin pieces.

6. To assemble the soup, divide the cooked rice noodles between 4 bowls. Add the sliced chicken on top of the noodles, and pour the hot broth over the chicken.

7. Serve hot and garnish the soup with bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, lime juice, and Sriracha sauce to taste.
