## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. To make the crust, mix the flour and salt together in a bowl.

3. Add the butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend until coarse crumbs form.

4. Slowly add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, while mixing, until the dough comes together and forms a ball.

5. Roll out the dough into a circle and transfer to a 9-inch (23cm) tart pan. Trim the edges and prick the bottom with a fork. Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.

6. To make the onion filling, heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

7. Add onions, salt, pepper, and sugar, and cook for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are caramelized and golden brown.

8. Add garlic and thyme, and cook for another 2 minutes.

9. Stir in flour and cook for 1-2 minutes.

10. Add beef broth and white wine, bring to a simmer, and cook for 5-7 minutes until the mixture thickens.

11. Pour the onion filling into the chilled crust and bake for 20-25 minutes until the crust is golden brown.

12. To make the cheese topping, mix the Gruyere cheese, Parmesan cheese, heavy cream, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.

13. Spread the cheese mixture over the onion filling and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

14. Serve hot and enjoy!
