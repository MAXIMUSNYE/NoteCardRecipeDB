| 1 lb       | Ground beef |

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt for the dough.
3. Add cold butter to the bowl and mix with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse sand.
4. Add cold water to the bowl and mix until the dough comes together.
5. Knead the dough for 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface, then wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
6. In a large skillet, cook ground beef over medium heat until browned.
7. Add chopped onion and bell pepper to the skillet and cook until vegetables are softened.
8. Mix in chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, and black pepper.
9. Pour in water and simmer for 5 minutes, until the mixture has thickened slightly.
10. Stir in sliced olives and remove the skillet from the heat.
11. Roll out the empanada dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness.
12. Cut out circles of dough with a cookie cutter or the opening of a drinking glass.
13. Place some of the beef filling onto each circle, then fold the dough over and crimp the edges with a fork to seal.
14. Place the empanadas onto a greased baking sheet.
15. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the empanadas are golden brown.
