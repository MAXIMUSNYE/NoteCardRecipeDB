# Homemade Fondant for Cake Decorating Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Simple Syrup:

| Ingredient | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Granulated sugar | 1 cup |
| Water | 1/2 cup |

### For the Fondant:

| Ingredient | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Marshmallows | 16 oz |
| Powdered sugar | 2 lbs |
| Shortening | 2 tbsp |
| Clear vanilla | 1 tsp |
| Gel food coloring (optional) | As needed |

## Directions

1. Make the simple syrup by combining the granulated sugar and water in a saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar completely dissolves. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.

2. In a separate microwave-safe bowl, melt the marshmallows in 30-second increments, stirring in between, until fully melted.

3. Add the cooled simple syrup to the melted marshmallows and stir until well combined.

4. In a large mixing bowl, sift the powdered sugar to remove any lumps.

5. Add the shortening to the powdered sugar and mix until it forms a crumbly mixture.

6. Add the marshmallow mixture and vanilla to the powdered sugar mixture, stirring until completely combined.

7. Turn the mixture out onto a clean and well-greased surface and knead until it becomes a smooth and pliable ball.

8. If desired, add gel food coloring and knead until the desired color is achieved.

9. Store the fondant in an airtight container or wrapped tightly in plastic wrap until ready to use.

**Note:** Fondant may become sticky if exposed to humidity. To fix, simply knead in more powdered sugar until desired consistency is reached.
