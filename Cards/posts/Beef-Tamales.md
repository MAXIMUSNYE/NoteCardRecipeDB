## Steps:

1. Begin by preparing the Beef Filling. In a large pot, add Chuck Roast, Garlic, Onion, Dried Oregano, Cumin, Chili Powder, Paprika, Salt, Black Pepper, and Beef Broth. Mix well and let boil.
2. Reduce heat to low and cover the pot. Allow the mixture to simmer for two and a half to three hours, until the beef is tender and falls apart easily. Alternatively, you can use a pressure cooker for faster cooking.
3. Remove the beef from the pot and shred it with a fork. Set the shredded beef aside.
4. Pour the leftover beef broth from the pot to a measuring cup. You should have around 1.5 to 2 cups of broth. If you have less, you can supplement with additional beef broth or water.
5. Next, prepare the Corn Dough. In a large mixing bowl, add Masa Harina, Baking Powder, Salt, and mix well.
6. Add Warm Water and mix until the dough has formed. Blend with a mixer, gradually adding Lard or Shortening until the dough is smooth.
7. In another bowl, soak the Corn Husks in Hot Water for 1 hour, or until they are soft and pliable.
8. Once the Corn Husks are ready, rinse them and dry with a towel.
9. Take one Corn Husk and apply approximately 2 tablespoons of the Corn Dough, spread it evenly all over the husk.
10. Add approximately 1 tablespoon of the Beef Filling and spread over the Corn Dough.
11. Roll the Corn Husk tightly so that the filling is completely enclosed.
12. Repeat this process with the remaining Corn Husks, Corn Dough, and Beef Filling.
13. Once you have made all the Tamales, place them in a steamer with the folded side down.
14. Fill it with water according to the manufacturer's instructions and cook for around 1 and a half to 2 hours, or until you can easily separate the Corn Husk from the Tamales.
15. Once fully cooked, serve hot and enjoy your delicious Beef Tamales!
