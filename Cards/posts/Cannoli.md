|--------------|----------------|
| 2 cups | all-purpose flour |
| 2 tbsp | sugar |
| 1/4 tsp | salt |
| 2 tbsp | butter, chilled and cubed |
| 1/4 cup | white wine |
| 1 egg | beaten |
| vegetable oil (for frying) |

### Cannoli filling:

| **Quantity** | **Ingredient** |

| 1/4 cup | mini chocolate chips |

### Toppings (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, mix flour, sugar, and salt until blended. Add the butter, and mix until it resembles coarse crumbs.
2. Add wine and egg to the mixture, and blend until a dough forms.
3. Knead the dough on a floured surface until it's smooth and elastic.
4. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
5. Roll the dough about 1/8-inch thick, and cut out circles about 3-4 inches in diameter with a cookie cutter.
6. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
7. Wrap each dough disc around a cannoli rod or a metal tube and press the edges together to seal.
8. Fry the shells by placing them in the oil until golden brown. Use tongs to carefully remove the shells and drain them on paper towels. 
9. Once the shells have cooled, gently remove the rods.
10. In a separate bowl, mix the ricotta, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until blended.
11. Fold in the mini chocolate chips.
12. Fill each cannoli shell with the ricotta mixture and sprinkle with desired toppings.
