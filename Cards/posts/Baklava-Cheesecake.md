## Ingredients

### For the Baklava crust:

|Ingredients | Quantity|
|------------|---------|
|Phyllo Dough | 12 sheets|
|Unsalted butter, melted | 1/2 cup|
|Ground cinnamon | 1 tsp|
|Ground cloves | 1 tsp|
|Ground nutmeg | 1 tsp|
|Finely chopped walnuts | 1/2 cup|
|Finely chopped pistachios | 1/2 cup|
|Fine bread crumbs | 1/4 cup|

### For the Cheesecake Filling:

|Ingredients | Quantity|
|------------|---------|
|Cream cheese, room temperature | 16 oz|
|Granulated sugar | 1 cup|
|Sour cream, room temperature | 1/2 cup|
|Vanilla extract | 1 tsp|
|Eggs, room temperature | 3|

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325F. Grease a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray.

2. To make the baklava crust, layer 6 sheets of phyllo dough on the bottom of the prepared pan, brushing each with the melted butter before adding the next sheet. Mix together the cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, walnuts, pistachios, and breadcrumbs in a bowl. Sprinkle half of this mixture over the phyllo sheets in the pan. Layer the remaining 6 sheets of phyllo dough over the first layer, again brushing each sheet with melted butter before adding the next one. Top the second layer of phyllo with the remaining half of the nut mixture. Press down the phyllo layers and nut mixture firmly into the pan.

3. To make the cheesecake filling, beat the cream cheese and sugar together in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Add in the sour cream and vanilla extract, and mix until smooth.

4. Add the eggs one at a time, beating on low speed until just combined after each addition. Pour the cheesecake filling over the baklava crust in the prepared pan.

5. Bake the cheesecake for about 60 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center is almost set, but still slightly jiggly.

6. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside for 30 more minutes, with the oven door slightly ajar.

7. Then, remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature for at least 2 hours.

8. Chill the cheesecake in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.

9. Serve and enjoy your delicious baklava cheesecake!
