5. Cut the skin off the gammon and score the remaining fat in a diamond pattern.
6. In a small bowl, mix the honey, mustard, apple cider vinegar, garlic, soy sauce, and brown sugar together to create the glaze.
7. Place the gammon joint in a roasting tin, brush the glaze all over the joint, and pop it in the preheated oven.
8. Roast for 20-25 minutes, basting occasionally with the remaining glaze.
9. Remove the gammon from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before carving.
10. Serve with your choice of sides. Enjoy!
