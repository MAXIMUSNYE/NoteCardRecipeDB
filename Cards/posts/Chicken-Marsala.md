# Recipe for Chicken Marsala

## Ingredients

### Chicken:
| Ingredients | Quantity |
|-------------|----------|
| Chicken breasts, boneless and skinless  | 4 |
| Flour  | 1/4 cup |
| Salt  | 1 tsp |
| Pepper  | 1 tsp |

### Sauce:
| Ingredients | Quantity |
|-------------|----------|
| Olive oil  | 2 tbsp |
| Onion, finely chopped  | 1 |
| Garlic, minced  | 3 cloves |
| Mushrooms, sliced  | 8 oz |
| Marsala wine  | 3/4 cup |
| Chicken broth  | 3/4 cup |
| Heavy cream  | 1/4 cup |
| Salt  | 1/2 tsp |
| Pepper  | 1/2 tsp |
| Cornstarch (optional)  | 1 tsp |

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°F.
2. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Dredge chicken breasts in the mixture, shaking off any excess.
3. Heat up a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Sear the chicken breasts for about 4-5 minutes on each side until golden brown. Place the chicken breasts on a baking sheet and put in the oven to keep them warm.
4. In the same skillet over medium heat, sauté onion and garlic for about 2 minutes.
5. Add sliced mushrooms to the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes or until browned, stirring occasionally.
6. Add marsala wine and chicken broth to the skillet, and bring it to a simmer. Let it cook for about 10 minutes or until the sauce has slightly thickened and reduced by a third.
7. Stir in heavy cream, salt, and pepper. If desired, mix cornstarch with water and add to the skillet for a thicker sauce. Let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes.
8. Remove chicken breasts from the oven and pour the sauce over them.

Enjoy your delicious Chicken Marsala!
