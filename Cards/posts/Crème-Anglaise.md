# Crème Anglaise Recipe

Crème Anglaise is a classic French custard sauce used as a base for many desserts. It is rich and creamy, yet light and delicate, and can be served warm or cold. Here is a simple recipe for making this delightful dessert sauce.

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredient |
|----------|------------|
| 1 cup | Heavy Cream |

## Directions

1. In a heavy saucepan, combine the heavy cream and whole milk and heat the mixture over medium-low heat until it is hot, but not boiling.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar until they are smooth and creamy.

3. Slowly pour the hot cream and milk mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.

4. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook, stirring constantly, over low heat until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. Do not let the mixture boil.

5. Once the custard has thickened, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.

6. Strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps or curdled bits.

7. Let the custard cool to room temperature, then chill it in the refrigerator until it is thoroughly cold.

8. To serve, spoon the crème anglaise over fresh berries or fruit and enjoy!

Note: Crème Anglaise can also be used as a base for ice cream and other desserts. Simply follow the directions above, then freeze the custard in an ice cream maker to make a delicious homemade ice cream.
