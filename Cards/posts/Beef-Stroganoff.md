## Steps

1. Begin by thinly slicing the beef sirloin into thin strips. Season it with salt and black pepper, then coat it with flour.
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef to the skillet and cook until browned on all sides, then remove it from the skillet and set it aside.
3. In the same skillet, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until softened for about 4-5 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the mushrooms have released their liquid. 
4. Pour in the beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, and Dijon mustard, stirring constantly to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.
5. Stir in the sour cream and add the cooked beef back to the skillet. Cook until heated through for 1-2 minutes.
6. While the beef stroganoff is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the egg noodles and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
7. Serve the beef stroganoff over a bed of egg noodles, optionally garnished with fresh parsley, and enjoy!

Enjoy your delicious and tangy Beef Stroganoff!
