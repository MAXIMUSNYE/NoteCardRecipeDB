| All-purpose flour | 2 cups     |
| Granulated sugar | 2 tablespoons |
| Salt             | 1/2 teaspoon  |

## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Mix well.

2. Add warm milk and mix until the dough comes together.

3. Knead on a floured surface until the dough is smooth and elastic.

4. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour.

5. In the meantime, prepare the butter layer. Put the cold butter between two sheets of wax paper and pound it with a rolling pin until it's about 1/2-inch thick.

6. Shape into a square and chill in the refrigerator until it's firm.

7. After an hour, take out the dough and roll it out into a rectangle on a floured surface.

8. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold the edges over to completely encase the butter.

9. Roll out the dough again into a rectangle, and then fold it in thirds like a letter.

10. Repeat the rolling and folding process twice more, refrigerating for 30 minutes between each fold.

11. Finally, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness.

12. Cut the dough into triangles and roll each one up from the wide end to the thin end.

13. Place on a baking sheet and let rise for 30-45 minutes.

14. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

15. Brush the croissants with an egg wash and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.

16. Enjoy your delicious homemade croissants!
