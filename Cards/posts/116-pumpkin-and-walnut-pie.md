# Pumpkin and Walnut Pie Recipe

### Ingredients

#### For the Pie Crust:

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 ¼ cups | all-purpose flour |
| ¼ tsp.   | salt |
| 1 Tbsp.  | granulated sugar |
| ½ cup    | unsalted butter, cold |
| 2-3 Tbsp.| ice water |

#### For the Pie Filling:

| Quantity | Ingredient |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1 ½ cups | canned pumpkin |
| 3         | large eggs |
| 1 cup     | granulated sugar |
| 1 tsp.    | ground cinnamon |
| 1 tsp.    | ground ginger |
| ½ tsp.    | ground nutmeg |
| ½ tsp.    | salt |
| 1 cup     | heavy cream |
| ½ cup     | chopped walnuts |

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients for the crust. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add it to the dry mixture. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work the butter into the flour mixture until small, pea-sized pieces of butter are visible.
3. Add the ice water to the mixture one tablespoon at a time, using a fork to combine the mixture until it comes together in a ball.
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pie crust dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Transfer the rolled-out dough to the pie pan and trim any excess dough. Place the pie crust in the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the filling.
5. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, eggs, sugar, spices, and salt until well combined. Slowly stir in the heavy cream until the mixture is smooth and well mixed. Fold in the walnuts.
6. Take the pie crust out of the refrigerator and pour the pumpkin filling into it.
7. Bake the pie for 50-60 minutes, or until the filling is set and the crust is golden brown.
8. Remove the pumpkin and walnut pie from the oven and let it cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
