|   1 tsp     |      cinnamon        |
|   1/4 tsp   |      nutmeg         |

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375F. 

2. In a large mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, and salt. 

3. Add in cubed unsalted butter into the mixing bowl and work it into the flour with your fingers or a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse sand. 

4. Slowly add ice water into the mixing bowl until the dough starts to come together. 

5. Flour a clean, flat surface and roll out the dough to fit your baking dish. 

6. Place the rolled-out dough into the fridge to chill while you prepare the filling. 

7. Peel and slice the apples and set aside. 

8. In a saucepan, melt butter and sugar over medium heat until it becomes a light caramel color. 

9. Add in the apples, cinnamon, and nutmeg and stir to coat the apples with the caramel. 

10. Cover the pan and let the mixture cook until the apples become tender and the caramel thickens. 

11. Remove the dough from the fridge and place the caramelized apples on top, ensuring an even distribution. 

12. Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the apples are bubbling. 

13. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. 

14. Invert the tart onto a serving plate, letting the caramel drizzle over the top. 

15. Serve and enjoy!
