## Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 375Â°F.

2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef, onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Cook for about 8-10 minutes until the beef is no longer pink and the vegetables are tender.

3. Add the cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine.

4. Add the beef broth to the skillet and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.

5. In a medium saucepan, combine the tomato sauce, beef broth, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix well and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5-7 minutes.

6. Spread a small amount of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.

7. Soften the tortillas by microwaving them for 20-30 seconds or cooking them in a dry skillet for 10-15 seconds on each side.

8. To assemble the enchiladas, spoon about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the beef mixture onto each tortilla. Roll up tightly and place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish.

9. Pour the remaining sauce over the enchiladas. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the top.

10. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

11. Remove from oven and sprinkle with chopped cilantro.

12. Serve with sour cream, if desired.

Enjoy your delicious homemade beef enchiladas!
