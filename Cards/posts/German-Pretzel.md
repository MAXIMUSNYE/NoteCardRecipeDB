## Directions

1. In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, yeast, brown sugar, and salt. Mix well.
2. Slowly add the warm water to the mixture and knead until the dough forms a smooth, elastic ball. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let the dough rise for about an hour.
3. Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
4. In a large pot, bring 8 cups of water to a boil. Add baking soda to the water and stir.
5. Divide the dough into 8-10 pieces, depending on how big you want your pretzels. Roll each piece into a long rope about 1/2 inch thick and shape into a pretzel.
6. Place each pretzel into the boiling water for 30 seconds, then remove with a slotted spoon and place onto the prepared baking sheet.
7. Sprinkle coarse salt onto each pretzel and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the pretzels are golden brown.
8. Brush the melted butter onto the pretzels when they come out of the oven.
9. Serve and enjoy your homemade German Pretzels!

Note: You can also serve with your favorite dipping sauce like mustard or cheese sauce.
