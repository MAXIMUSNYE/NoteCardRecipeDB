|Unsalted butter, cold and cubed|1 cup|
|Salt|1 tsp|
|Ice water|6 to 8 tbsp|

### Filling

|Ingredient|Amount|
|--- |--- |
|Beef chuck, cut into small cubes|1 1/2 lbs|
|Baby bella mushrooms, sliced|8 oz|
|Onion, chopped|1 medium|
|Garlic, minced|2 cloves|
|All-purpose flour|2 tbsp|
|Beef broth|1 cup|
|Worcestershire sauce|1 tbsp|
|Thyme leaves, fresh|1 tsp|
|Salt and pepper, to taste|

## Instructions

1. To make the pie crust, combine flour, salt, and butter in a food processor until pea-sized pieces form. Slowly add in ice water until the dough comes together. Divide into two disks, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes.

2. Preheat oven to 375°F.

3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef for 5-7 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.

4. In the same skillet, sauté mushrooms, onion, and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes.

5. Sprinkle flour over vegetables and cook for 1 minute.

6. Slowly stir in beef broth and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 minutes or until thickened.

7. Add the beef back into the skillet and stir in thyme leaves, salt, and pepper.

8. Roll out one pie crust disk and place into a 9-inch pie dish. Pour in the beef mixture.

9. Roll out the second pie crust disk and place on top of the filling. Trim the excess crust and crimp the edges.

10. Cut slits in the top of the crust and brush with egg wash.

11. Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.

12. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!
