|----------------|----------------|
| Beef chuck roast | 1 pound |
| Mushrooms | 1 cup |
| Onion, chopped | 1 medium |
| Garlic, minced | 3 cloves |
| Worcestershire sauce | 2 tablespoons |

### For the Pie Crust
| Item           | Quantity       |
|----------------|----------------|
| Flour | 2 cups |
| Salt | 1 teaspoon |
| Butter, cubed | 3/4 cup |
| Ice water | 6-8 tablespoons |

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Begin by preparing the filling. Cut the beef into bite-size cubes and season with salt and pepper.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the beef. Cook until browned on all sides, then remove from pan and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the chopped onions and sauté for 2-3 minutes until they become translucent.
5. Add the minced garlic and mushrooms and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the mushrooms have browned and the garlic is fragrant.
6. Sprinkle the flour over the mushroom and onion mixture, and stir to coat.
7. Pour in Worcestershire sauce and beef broth, and stir until the mixture thickens.
8. Return the beef to the skillet, and stir to coat with the sauce mixture.
9. Let simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the beef is cooked through.
10. Roll out the pie crust on a lightly floured surface and cut into an 11-inch circle.
11. Place the pie crust in a 9-inch pie dish.
12. Add the beef and mushroom filling to the pie crust.
13. Roll out the remaining pie crust on a lightly floured surface and make a 10-inch circle.
14. Place the top pie crust over the filling and pinch the edges of the top and bottom crust together to seal.
15. Cut several slits in the top of the crust to allow steam to escape while baking.
16. Place the pie in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
17. Remove the pie from the oven and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
