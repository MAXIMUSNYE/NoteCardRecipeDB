| 2 cups   | Masa harina |

## Instructions

1. In a large skillet, heat up olive oil over medium heat. Add tomato paste, cumin powder, chili powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Stir well.

2. Add shredded chicken to the skillet and mix to combine with the spices. Cook for 5-7 minutes and set aside.

3. In a mixing bowl, mix masa harina, chicken broth, lard, baking powder, salt and pepper together until well combined.

4. Take a corn husk, dry it with a towel, and lay it flat with the narrow end at the top. Place around 2 tablespoons of masa mixture in the center of the husk. Spread the mixture evenly over the husk, leaving a margin on the sides.

5. Add 1-2 tablespoons of chicken filling over the masa mixture in the center.

6. Bring both sides of the husk to the center, over the filling, and fold the narrow end over to the opposite side.

7. Tie the tamale with a string or wrap it with another husk.

8. Repeat this process until all the masa and chicken mixture is used up.

9. Arrange the tamales in a steamer basket, cover with a lid, and place over a pot of boiling water.

10. Steam the tamales for 60-90 minutes or until the masa is fully cooked and firm to the touch.

11. Serve warm with your favorite salsa and garnishes. Enjoy!
