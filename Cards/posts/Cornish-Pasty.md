# Cornish Pasty Recipe

Cornish pasties are a traditional English pastry that is perfect for a hearty meal or snack. The filling is made with beef, potatoes, onions, and carrots, and is baked in a flaky pastry crust. Here's a simple recipe to make your own delicious Cornish pasties at home.

## Ingredients

### For the Pastry Crust:
|Ingredients| Amount|
|----------|-------|
|All-purpose flour | 2 1/2 cups |
|Salt | 1 tsp |
|Unsalted butter, cold | 1 cup |
|Ice water | 5-6 tbsp |

### For the Filling:
|Ingredients| Amount|
|----------|-------|
|Beef, diced | 1 pound |
|Potatoes, peeled and diced | 2 cups |
|Carrots, peeled and diced | 1 cup |
|Onion, chopped | 1/2 cup |
|Salt | 1 tsp |
|Pepper | 1/2 tsp |

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. To make the pastry crust, mix the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl.

3. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and add them to the bowl with the flour mixture.

4. Use your fingers or a pastry cutter to mix the butter into the flour until it's crumbly in texture.

5. Add ice water to the mixture, one tablespoon at a time, while stirring. Mix until the dough comes together.

6. Divide the dough into four equal parts and shape each into a round disk.

7. To make the filling, mix the beef, potatoes, carrots, onion, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.

8. Roll out each pastry disk into a circle, approximately 6 inches in diameter.

9. Divide the filling mixture into four equal parts and place each on one side of each pastry circle.

10. Fold the other half of the pastry over the filling to create a half-moon shape. Use your fingers or a fork to crimp the edges closed.

11. Cut three slits on the top of each pasty to allow steam to escape while baking.

12. Place the pasties on a baking sheet and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.

13. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before serving.

Enjoy your delicious Cornish pasties!
