## Steps to Make Beef Marsala Pasta
1. Start by cooking the pasta according to the instructions on the package. Add salt to the boiling water to add flavor to the pasta. Once it’s cooked to your preferred level of doneness, strain the pasta and set it aside.
2. While the pasta is cooking, slice the beef sirloin steak into thin pieces, about ½ inch thick. Then season the beef strips with salt and pepper.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add the garlic. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant.
4. Add the sliced beef to the skillet and cook for about 3 minutes per side or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F. Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature.
5. Remove the beef from the skillet and set it aside on a plate.
6. Increase the heat to high and add the Marsala wine to the skillet. Let it cook for about 2 minutes so it can reduce.
7. Add the beef broth to the skillet and let it cook down for about 5 minutes.
8. Once the broth has cooked down, add the heavy cream to the skillet and whisk everything together.
9. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 5 to 7 minutes until it thickens up.
10. Once the sauce is ready, add the cooked pasta and cooked beef to the skillet. Toss everything together to ensure that the pasta is coated evenly with the sauce.
11. Serve your hot Beef Marsala Pasta in your favorite pasta bowl and garnish it with some fresh parsley.
