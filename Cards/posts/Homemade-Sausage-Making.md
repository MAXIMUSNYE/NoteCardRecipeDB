# Homemade Sausage Making Recipe

If you're tired of store-bought sausage, why not try making your own? It's not as difficult as you might think, and the results are worth it. Here's a basic recipe to get you started. 

## Ingredients

### For the Sausage

| Ingredient | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Ground pork | 2 lbs |
| Salt | 2 tsp |
| Black pepper | 1 tsp |
| Red pepper flakes | 1/4 tsp |
| Sage | 1 tsp |
| Thyme | 1/2 tsp |
| Brown sugar | 1 tsp |
| Garlic powder | 1 tsp |
| Water | 1/4 cup |

### For the Casing

| Ingredient | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Pork casings | 5 feet |
| White vinegar | 1/4 cup |
| Water | 1/4 cup |

## Steps

1. Soak the casings in cold water for at least 30 minutes, or according to package instructions.

2. In a large bowl, mix together the ground pork, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, sage, thyme, brown sugar, and garlic powder. Add the water and mix until well combined.

3. Prepare your sausage stuffer according to the manufacturer's instructions.

4. Thread one soaked casing onto the stuffer, leaving a bit of overhang at the end.

5. Spoon the sausage mixture into the stuffer and begin to crank the handle, allowing the sausage to fill the casing.

6. Once the casing is filled, twist the sausage into links, starting at one end and working your way down. 

7. In a large pot, combine the white vinegar and water. Add the sausages and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

8. Cook the sausages until they are firm and cooked through, about 10-15 minutes.

9. Remove the sausages from the pot and pat dry with paper towels. Allow them to cool for a few minutes before serving.
